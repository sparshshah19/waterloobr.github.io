            <h3><span class="bold">WBR</span>: A lot of startups build their businesses around a problem. For Lunaria,
                what is that problem and how did you come to discover it?
            </h3>

            <p><span class="bold">Cassie</span>: Lunaria solves the problem of diversity and inclusion in all spaces of
                the world by reframing the way people imagine diversity and inclusion.
            </p>

            <p>Right now, companies increasingly want to integrate diversity and inclusion (D&I) into their culture, but
                they are not taking a customized approach to their own needs. For example, something that is very common
                at the moment is D&I workshops and trainings. Lunaria encourages people to take a data-driven approach
                to diversity and inclusion by surveying their employees, tracking demographic information and
                determining their needs and investing in those needs.
            </p>

            <p>Lunaria equips companies with the information they need to choose the right diversity and inclusion
                initiatives to invest in. We then continuously evaluate their next steps, next goals, and the
                effectiveness of their chosen initiatives.
            </p>

            <img class="singleImage" id="approachDiagram" src="images/article6Images/2 - business model.png"
                alt="Lunaria's Approach Diagram">

            <h3><span class="bold">WBR</span>: What prompted the idea of wanting to work in D&I and what led you to the
                current solution you are working in now?
            </h3>

            <p><span class="bold">Cassie</span>: Lunaria has pivoted quite a bit since its inception. We initially
                started off working with nonprofits by performing impact evaluations. However, we found that we were
                getting asked to do more evaluations that focused on more than the direct outcomes of a program.
            </p>

            <p>If we were hired to evaluate a STEM program, we would measure not only the interest garnered and program
                effectiveness, but also the diversity of its participants for example. And so now, what we do is we work
                with our customers on finding different ways to measure the impact of diversity and inclusion; we
                measure with a data-driven approach on numerous metrics ranging from the impact of D&I initiatives to
                how people feel when accessing resources.
            </p>

            <p>The D&I industry is evolving out of the non-profit space too, as growing compliance requirements and new
                government regulations are being put in place which encourage companies to invest in D&I.
            </p>

            <h3>What kind of role does D&I play in an organization?</h3>

            <p><span class="bold">Cassie</span>: Ideally, D&I should be integrated into all levels of decision-making at
                a company: from
                departments, to hiring, recruiting, management, to day-to-day operations. There have been many studies
                that demonstrate how beneficial D&I is in business; for example, diverse and inclusive companies have
                been linked to higher profits due to higher levels of cooperation between companies, higher retention,
                and higher hiring rates. So it is really about integrating D&I into the culture of companies at all
                levels and that is really fun. Through our diversity audit where we look at anything from hiring
                practices, to asset management practices and how our customers evaluate their suppliers, D&I can be
                ingrained in every aspect of a company.
            </p>

            <h3><span class="bold">WBR</span>: What kind of impact has the data-driven approach had on companies?
            </h3>

            <p><span class="bold">Cassie</span>: I think one of the biggest things is that a lot of companies don't know
                where to start or don't know what's working. So through our data-driven approach, it is really powerful
                to be able to show management how their investment has changed peoples livesâ€”whether it is a workshop,
                training, or artifacts that make people feel like they belong. Providing anonymity in the service allows
                employers to get raw responses from their employees that can be telling to the real situation happening
                within their firm.
            </p>

            <h3><span class="bold">WBR</span>: How has your involvement as an Entrepreneur in Residence helped you grow
                your business?
            </h3>

            <p><span class="bold">Cassie</span>: My experience at Waterloo has definitely helped. I think we're really
                lucky to be in a community like
                Waterloo which has so many entrepreneurial resources and opportunities to advance your skill set,
                improve your ideas and connect with other entrepreneurs here that have gone through similar things. I am
                really grateful to be a part of this type of ecosystem right now. We currently in the Jump Start program
                with the University of Waterloo and the Accelerator Centre. Through these programs, we get the
                opportunity to engage with mentors and other companies which has been extremely helpful.</p>

            <h3><span class="bold">WBR</span>: What was the biggest technical challenge when it came to launching your
                business?
            </h3>

            <p><span class="bold">Cassie</span>: In the beginning, as a non-technical founder, I found the technical
                side of things to be the challenge. More recently, I am finding that technical skills is getting easier
                to bridge because we can surround ourselves with more technically competent people, and taking on
                classes and projects to fill in our knowledge. But now as we grow and expand our team, the challenge
                that I am trying to work on is how we are going to grow our own culture. That is, how we can share a
                vision across different groups of people and how we can grow fast yet still make everyone feel like they
                are a part of that founding idea.
            </p>

            <h3><span class="bold">WBR</span>: What role do you think diversity and inclusion will play in the years to
                come?
            </h3>

            <p><span class="bold">Cassie</span>: With D&I, we're seeing growth in popularity more than ever before. Now
                        it's really exciting because we're looking at more intersectionality within identities, race,
                        culture, accessibility, religion, education and socioeconomic background. In this age, we have a
                        greater diversity of people working in the same space than ever before; some people are
                        physically there and some people are there virtually. As companies become more diverse, the
                        question of how do you make a space for everyone to thrive has become a more prevalent question.
            </p>

            <p>Changes in government policy are good indicators of trends in society that may be here to stay. As more
                legislation is being put forward, it is evident that more responsibility is being expected on the side
                of the employer. As such, we can observe the longevity of D&I and the benefit of investing in it now and
                taking it into the future. D&I is continuous, so actions taken in 2019 may not carry you through to 2020
                and beyond. D&I is something that should be with your company on an ongoing basis and should be
                integrated within your company culture.
            </p>

            <p>I think itâ€™s going to be really exciting to see how the changes in policy and different populations
                working together will drive decisions.
            </p>

            <h3><span class="bold">WBR</span>: Advice for entrepreneurs in work and in life?
            </h3>

            <p><span class="bold">Cassie</span>: The first thing I would say is to not wait. I think that if I had not
                gone to Waterloo, I probably wouldn't have started a company. Waterloo truly has so many resources for
                students to try ideas. People in the region of Waterloo as a community are very accepting. This is a
                community where people are very open and welcoming: if I look up to someone who might be a CEO of a
                company down the road, I can reach out for advice and have a 10-minute conversation with them.
            </p>

            <p>Furthermore, there are many courses where projects can expand into a business; from the engineering
                capstones to research-based courses, there are a lot of ways to imagine your assignments in a way that
                could be turned into a startup business.

                                largest technology venture funds in the world. However, after numerous failed

            <p>Thanks to its deep history and strong brand, Disney has garnered a reputation for being one of the
                world’s leaders in the entertainment industry. Founded in 1923, Disney’s success started with its
                animation studio through its creation of memorable characters such as Mickey Mouse, Goofy, and Donald
                Duck. Since then, Disney has expanded into the broadcasting industry, established some of the world’s
                most well-known amusement parks, and has added to its long list of characters. With markets moving
                towards on-demand video, specifically streaming video on-demand (SVOD) services, Disney’s next steps
                involved the release of Disney+. Announced on April 11, 2019, Disney+ is Disney’s newest venture in the
                SVOD industry. The streaming service gives on-demand access to Disney’s exclusive content library
                spanning its key brands including Marvel, Star Wars, National Geographic, Disney Channel, and Pixar. At
                7 USD a month, how does Disney+ stack up against its competition?
            </p>

            <h3>Disney’s expansion to SVOD
            </h3>


            <p>How did Disney set themselves up for Disney+? The company was never originally known for its digital
                content but it has made strategic acquisitions in the past decade to set itself up for success in this
                growing market. Disney’s first step was to expand its film library with acquisitions of Pixar, Lucas
                Films, and 21st Century Fox in 2006, 2012, and 2019 respectively.
            </p>

            <p>All three of these acquisitions have been tremendously successful and key to establishing Disney’s
                foothold in the digital film market. Disney then entered the SVOD market through the acquisition of
                Bamtech and the purchase of Hulu. Bamtech, originally the streaming service for Major League Baseball,
                acted as a platform for Disney’s release of ESPN+, and provides the digital infrastructure for Disney+.
            </p>

            <p>Furthermore, Hulu, an independent streaming service, gave Disney valuable expertise and experience in the
                SVOD market. Together, all of these strategic acquisitions have contributed to the formation and launch
                of Disney+.</p>

                class="singleImage" id="disneySponsors">

            <h3 id="moreImportant">Drivers for success
            </h3>

            <h3>Comprehensive Family Platform
            </h3>

            <p>Disney+ differentiates itself from the competition by providing a family-oriented platform that consumers
                can buy in addition to their current on-demand service. With growing digital viewership, Generation Z
                represents a tremendous opportunity for Disney+ subscribership. In 2017, Netflix found a 61% increase in
                kids and family streaming numbers worldwide.<sup>1</sup> By segmenting themselves as a platform for
                younger
                viewers, Disney+ can take advantage of this rising trend.
            </p>

            <p>Furthermore, the content featured on Disney+ appeals to individual family members: youth, teens, and
                adults. For example, Disney Channel, Disney Junior, and Pixar films primarily target viewers aged 2-16.
                On the other hand, Marvel’s largest demographic are those between the ages of 16 – 20. Finally, Star
                Wars appeals to a wide variety of age groups. While most of these brands are specifically targeted
                towards younger demographics, brands like Star Wars and Marvel also have a strong following among
                adults, including parents. By providing content aligning with multiple age groups, Disney+ further
                cements its position as a comprehensive family platform. When looking at the younger generation, younger
                children make up a large portion of the population and are increasingly being exposed to SVOD services.
                In 2019, it was estimated that 40.66% of households had children under the age of 18 in the
                US.<sup>2</sup> Within
                this demographic, access to devices has significantly increased among children. According to a report
                done by Common Sense Media, 98% of children under the age of 8 live in houses with access to mobile
                device or a TV.<sup>3</sup> Coupled with the fact that in 2018, 68% of families were subscribed to at
                least one
                SVOD service, SVOD viewership among younger children will inevitably increase significantly in the
                coming years.<sup>4</sup> By focusing on developing content for the younger demographics, Disney+ will
                be able
                to effectively take advantage of these trends versus competitors.
            </p>

            <h3>Unparalleled exclusive content</h3>

            <p>As mentioned previously, Disney’s content library is extensive, and their studio has had great success.
                Disney is the first film studio to make over $5 billion consecutively over three years. In 2016, Disney
                also broke the record for highest grossing year, generating $7.6 billion. This suggests box office
                success will be a key driver for Disney+ adoption. While Pixar and Lucas entertainment have been
                successful, Marvel has been the main driver for box office sales. Since the debut of Marvel’s cinematic
                universe in 2008, Marvel has had at least one movie rank in the top 10 for box office sales every single
                year. Just this year, Avengers: Endgame became the fastest film to gross $2 billion. Looking into the
                future, Marvel will continue to be Disney’s cash cow and produce results. Furthermore, even stronger
                than Marvel’s box office success is their cultural impact. From challenging movie storytelling to
                popularizing end credit scenes, Marvel has made a significant impact on the film industry. Its 22
                intertwined films have captivated moviegoers and have developed quite a following among audiences.
                Marvel does a great job of not only appealing to traditional comic fans but also introducing newcomers
                to the MCU.
            </p>

            <p>Watching Marvel films has become a norm among today’s moviegoers, and box office sales cement the MCU as
                being the most popular series in today’s film industry. This type of brand loyalty is akin to that of TV
                shows and will drive subscriptions for Disney+. To further understand the value that Marvel adds to
                Disney+’s success, consider HBO Now and Game of Thrones. HBO Now is the streaming service that was
                released by HBO in 2015 and features programming available on the HBO platform. The platform’s content
                is restricted to HBO, similar to Disney+. While not being at the top of the market, the main driver
                behind the platform’s success has been Game of Thrones (GoT). Much like Marvel, GoT is widely watched by
                audiences and is one of the most popular television shows. When looking at HBO Now’s subscription rates
                over the years, they jump significantly during the years in which Game of Thrones is featured. In 2017,
                subscriptions to HBO Now jumped up by 91% following the release of season 7.<sup>5</sup> This
                demonstrates the
                impact that even one successful franchise can have on subscription numbers. While not a direct
                comparison, Marvel and GoT command similar levels of viewership loyalty, with fans eager to be the first
                to watch upcoming productions. However, unlike GoT, Marvel is accompanied by other successful franchises
                produced under Pixar and Lucas Films, which will create sustained subscriber growth.

            <h3>Strong Brand Value
            </h3>

            <p>In a market filled with proven competitors, can Disney’s brand command viewers to adopt Disney+? Disney’s
                brand value will drive subscriber growth despite the number of competitors in the SVOD streaming market.
                The brand was ranked 14th in the world by Interbrand and its brand value in dollar amount has been
                increasing: it increased from $27.1B in 2004 to $39.8B in 2018. Disney’s studio property, for example,
                has been a main driver behind the company’s success, as Disney aggressively monetizes them through
                multiple channels. Take Frozen: in addition to its 1.3 billion USD gross at the box office, Disney has
                capitalized on the film’s success by releasing merchandise, songs, an ice show, and books. Frozen
                merchandising sales alone were estimated to be around $1 billion, almost equalling box office sales. The
                strength of Disney’s characters across multiple channels demonstrates Disney’s universal appeal which
                translates to higher Disney+ subscribership. Disney fans are captivated by their characters and will be
                willing to pay additional monthly fees to add Disney+ to their SVOD lineup.
            </p>

            <img src="images/article1Images/frozen 2.png" alt="Frozen Statistics" class="singleImage" id="frozenStats">

            <p>Furthermore, fans have already demonstrated demand for easily accessible Disney content. Looking at
                Disney’s home video sales, they have greatly outperformed the home video market. While international
                physical home entertainment spending decreased by 36% from 2015 - 2018, Disney’s home video sales have
                only decreased by a mere 3% across this period. This suggests that the Disney brand resonates strongly
                with its audience, and can generate sales within a declining market. Moreover, steady home video sales
                are indicative of the demand for on-demand Disney content. Coupled together, Disney+ will take advantage
                of an already existing demand for content, and further capitalize on its strong brand.
            </p>

            <h3>Impact of Disney+ Launch
            </h3>

            <p>All things considered, the timing for Disney+’s launch is perfect. After the launch of the platform,
                Disney + has garnered over 10 million subscribers in about a week. Within hours of launch, Netflix lost
                about 3% of its market share. The company’s digital infrastructure, successful content library, and
                strong family brand are ripe to be capitalized on, especially when considering the increasing use of
                SVOD services. Disney once again has shown its ability to adapt and innovate in an ever changing market.
            </p>

                            <p> ​At its peak, Forever 21 had over 700 stores worldwide, and took the Changs, its
                                owners, from working class immigrants to billionaires. However, all was brought to a

                            <h4>SoftBank's Vision Fund: A Cautionary Tale for all Venture Capital Firms</h4>
                            <p>​In 2017, after raising $100 billion, Softbank launched Vision Fund, one of the
                                largest technology venture funds in the world. However, after numerous failed
                                investments
                                in firms like
                                Wag and WeWork, skeptics are beginning to question the strategy this fund has
                                adopted.
                                What can we learn from the Vision Fund’s failures, and what are the implications for
                                the
                                broader industry?</p>

## file navigation (a work in progress)
Changes will be continually made to make the repository more maintainable as it grows. Currently, the repository organizational structure is as follows: 

```
    .
    ├── articles                   # termly articles 
    │   ├── fall-2020      
    │   ├── spring-2020  
    ├── assets                     
    │   ├── img
    │       ├── logo               # all article graphics are stored here 
    │       ├── winter-2021        # NEW DIRECTORY  
    │           ├── covers
    │           ├── articles       # within here are folders for each article its respective graphics
    │       ├── team               # team photos
    │   |...                       # other styling/js/etc

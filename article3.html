            <h3>Introduction</h3>

            <p>On April 10, 2019, Canada’s largest wireless companies competed against each other at Canada’s 5G
                Spectrum Auction. Being the first 5G auction, the companies sought out to acquire spectrum licenses from
                the federal government which will enable 5G deployment in urban, suburban and rural communities.
                Collectively, wireless operators including Rogers, Telus, and Freedom mobile spent a total of $3.47 B to
                purchase the airwaves needed to power next-generation 5G networks.<sup>14</sup></p>

            <p>Investments into 5G technology are becoming an increasingly prevalent pattern as operators, equipment
                manufacturers, and device manufacturers alike attempt to capitalize on the expected mass adoption by
                consumers. But what exactly is 5G technology? How did it start, how does it work, and where will it take
                us?
            </p>

            <h3>History</h3>

            <p>In the 1980s, the first generation of wireless cellular technology emerged, and has been developing ever
                since. What is a generation, and how did we get to number five of them? The graphic below depicts the
                journey from 1G to the now developing 5G over the course of 40 years.<sup>5</sup></p>

            <img class="singleImage" id="svfTimeLine" src="images/article3Images/SVF - timeline.png" alt="SVF Timeline">

            <h3>Difference</h3>

            <p>You probably have a mobile device supported on a 4G network. What is the difference between 4G and 5G?
            </p>

            <img src="images/article3Images/SVF - wavelengths.png" class="singleImage" id="waveLength"
                alt="Wavelenghts Graph">

            <p>In a sense, cell phones can be considered two-way radios. For example, when making a call, your voice is
                converted into an electrical signal that is transmitted to the nearest cell tower via radio waves,
                bounced through a network of cell towers, to finally reach the individual you are contacting. The same
                happens when you send other forms of data, such as photos and videos.
            </p>

            <p>Since the 5G network has 5 - 50x shorter wavelengths than its predecessor, users are able to send more
                data in a shorter time period. Contrarily, since these higher frequency signals cannot travel as far,
                more infrastructure is needed to boost signals where 5G is offered.
            </p>

            <h3>Capabilities</h3>

            <p>You might be thinking, “My phone works pretty well. How much better can 5G get?” There are 3 main
                benefits to 5G technology: faster speeds, lower latency, and increased connectivity.
            </p>

            <p><span class="bold">5G will lower latency.</span>Latency is the response time between a user request and
                action being taken by a simple function, application, or machine. 5G’s capacity for reduced latency will
                decrease lag and improve streaming applications like online gaming, video calling, and interactive live
                sports.</p>

            <p><span class="bold">5G will increase internet speed and connectivity.</span>With 5G, downloading an HD
                movie takes seconds versus 6 minutes for 4G LTE.<sup>13</sup> Furthermore, the greater capacity offered
                by 5G will
                allow support for more devices and more data-intensive tasks, such as “Internet of Things” devices in
                smart cities, autonomous vehicles, smart grid management, and remote healthcare. That is, these devices
                contain both sensors that collect data, and software to upload data to the cloud. The software would
                then able able to directly exchange data with other connected devices, and allow for analytics and
                insights to be generated from the data produced.<sup>11</sup></p>

            <h3>Impact</h3>

            <p>Furthermore, 5G is anticipated to have a significant impact on our day-to-day lives in 3 ways:
            </p>

            <p><span class="bold">5G will increase data traffic.</span> 5G will create exponential growth in data
                traffic, allowing for the increasing adoption of HD music and video streaming and cloud-native
                applications. According to Cisco, a multinational IT and networking conglomerate, mobile data usage
                growth alone is expected to increase from 7 to 49 Exabytes (1 Exabyte = 1,048,576 TB) by 2021,
                representing a 47% CAGR from 2016 to 2021.<sup>6</sup></p>

            <p><span class="bold">5G will accelerate the internet of things.</span> Currently, all four major US mobile
                operators are involved with smart city projects ranging from public transit, water management, and
                street lighting. Along with smart cities, projects related to smart homes and smart buildings are also
                being taken on, which will increase the demand for the 5G technology due to low latency.</p>

            <p><span class="bold">5G will improve robotics surgery.</span> 5G technology will allow doctors to use VR
                goggles to perform surgery remotely through instant haptic feedback. More recently, Ericsson, a Swedish
                telecommunications company, and King’s College in London showcased this application at the Mobile World
                Congress in Barcelona.<sup>8</sup> This will redefine the way surgeries are conducted by allowing
                patients to
                access to the expertise of specialized surgeons in different parts of the world, making physical
                distance irrelevant.</p>

            <p><span>5G will make self driving car faster and safer.</span> Self-driving cars rely on the data generated
                by hundreds of sensors positioned throughout the vehicle. With existing 4G technology, handling,
                processing, and analysis of this data is not currently possible, due to the fact that these systems need
                to mimic the timing of human reflexes. 5G would ameliorate this issue due to its low latency and high
                speed in transferring large data.<sup>2</sup></p>

                alt="Visual Chart of 5G Pros and Cons">

            <h3>Concerns</h3>

            <p>5G has far reaching capabilities, and is slated to have a significant positive impact on consumers and
                companies alike. However, there are 2 main issues: political tensions, and potential health effects.</p>

            <p><span class="bold">5G has sparked political tensions.</span> In May 2019, President Trump banned US tech
                companies from using telecom equipment that posed a threat to national security. This led to the
                Commerce Department placing Huawei on a trade blacklist, causing sales of U.S.-made goods to Huawei to
                be restricted.<sup>9</sup> Furthermore, telecom giants like Nokia and Ericsson may be forced to move
                production
                outside of China in order to continue providing equipment to the U.S. In fact, Google recently announced
                the movement of its Pixel smartphone production from China to Vietnam to avoid the looming concerns of
                US-China trade hostilities.<sup>10</sup></p>

            <p><span class="bold">5G has the potential for adverse health effects.</span> Due to 5G networks’ use of
                higher frequency fields, medical professionals are concerned about the possibility of human tissue
                penetration.<sup>16</sup> Depending on the exposure duration, frequency, and temperature increase, this
                could lead
                to heat stroke and burns. Similarly, the WHO IARC<sup>12</sup>, an agency conducting research into the
                causes of
                human cancer, the radiofrequency electromagnetic fields associated with 5G networks has been classified
                as a potential human carcinogen.<sup>3</sup> However, the large majority of mainstream scientists
                continue to see
                no conclusive evidence of harm from cell phone radio waves. David Robert Grimes, a cancer researcher at
                the University of Oxford, suggests, "If phones are linked to cancer, we’d expect to see a marked uptick.
                Yet we do not."<sup>4</sup></p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>

            <div class="conclusionLayout">

                <p>Although 5G will not replace 4G immediately due to headwinds including infrastructure requirements
                    and health concerns, its adoption is expected to grow significantly over time. By 2025, 49% of North
                    American mobile connections are expected to be running on 5G networks, a significant increase from
                    1% in 2019.<sup>1</sup></p>

                    id="conclusionChart">

            </div>

            <p>In conclusion, as a result of exponentially growing investments from telecom enterprises, 5G is an
                incredibly pervasive technology slated to transform Canadian’s way of living: from faster downloads, to
                IOT-connected households, to improved robotic surgery.

                            <p> ​At its peak, Forever 21 had over 700 stores worldwide, and took the Changs, its
                                owners, from working class immigrants to billionaires. However, all was brought to a
                                halt
                                with their recent September 2019 bankruptcy. How did this American dream turn into a
                                nightmare? What led Forever 21 to file for bankruptcy in a market that is still
                                heavily
                                reliant on fast
                                fashion brands? Take a look behind the business and marketing strategies that
                                contributed
                                to the collapse of oneof the world’s leading brands.</p>

                            <p>​In 2017, after raising $100 billion, Softbank launched Vision Fund, one of the
                                largest technology venture funds in the world. However, after numerous failed
                                investments
                                in firms like
                                Wag and WeWork, skeptics are beginning to question the strategy this fund has
                                adopted.
                                What can we learn from the Vision Fund’s failures, and what are the implications for
                                the
                                broader industry?</p>

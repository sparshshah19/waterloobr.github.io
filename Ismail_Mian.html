                        <p class="mb-30"><b>Leveraging Experience - An Interview with Alumnus; Ismail Mian<br>INTERVIEW: Ismail Mian, PJT Partners</b></p>
                        <p class="mb-30">Waterloo Business Review had the opportunity to sit down with alumnus Ismail Mian over the summer to speak to him about his work experiences, as well as his time at the School of Accounting and Finance (SAF), to gain insight into careers in capital markets. Ismail graduated from the Accounting and Financial Management (AFM) program in 2018 and now works in New York City as an investment banking analyst at PJT Partners in the Mergers & Acquisitions group within Strategic Advisory. He previously worked as an Investment Banking Summer Analyst at Lazard San Francisco’s Technology Mergers & Acquisitions Advisory group prior to graduating from the University of Waterloo.</p>
                        <p class="mb-30">Ismail was born in Pakistan and attended several international schools before starting high school in Canada. Growing up, his family moved around a lot due to the busy nature of his father’s career in a senior leadership role as a Chartered Accountant (CA). Early on, Ismail gained exposure to the world of accounting and was inspired to study something in business. He had the intention to pursue a CPA designation, which ultimately led him to the Accounting and Financial Management (AFM) program at the University of Waterloo. Although Ismail arrived at Waterloo with a focus on pursuing a career in accounting, his interests changed after he took his first finance course, which strongly influenced his decision to pursue a full-time career in capital markets. Upon completing his first finance course, he met with his professor to discuss his upcoming co-op term in assurance at PwC.</p>
                        <p class="mb-30">Through his co-op experiences in the assurance group, Ismail had the chance to audit asset management clients at the firm, his first exposure to finance. Following his co-op experiences in assurance, Ismail knew he wanted to explore the alluring world of finance, and pursued related experiences in the School of Accounting and Finance and to prepare himself for opportunities.</p>  
                        <p class="mb-30">After having diverse experiences within different investment banking product and industry groups at CIBC, BMO and Lazard, Ismail explained the dynamic environment was what drew him in. He explained, “Each day presents its own requirements and you don't always know what’s coming down the pipeline.”</p>
                        <p class="mb-30">Leveraging public and private data, bankers form holistic views of businesses, and construct financial models, two skills which are incredibly transferable. At CIBC’s Equity Capital Markets (ECM) group, Ismail described his experience as a split between traditional investment banking and Sales and Trading, and became a lot more in tune with market developments and pricing. As Ismail continued to explore areas of interest within finance, he took on a more traditional role within BMO’s Global Metals and Mining group. Having had experiences at two banks within different groups, it enabled exposure to invaluable knowledge and insight through differing experience, allowing Ismail to explore particular areas within finance of greater interest and appeal.</p> 
                        <p class="mb-30">Reflecting upon his time, Ismail has one key piece of advice to current students . From a more professional and personal perspective in preparation for full-time recruitment; a support system is imperative. In Ismail’s experience, some of the best teaching tools came from outside the classroom. Notably the Student Investment Fund (SIF) and Student Venture Fund (SVF). These funds allowed Ismail to gain greater exposure, connect with students to build relationships while also receiving mentorship. In the summer of 2017, while in Lazard’s San FranciscoTechnology M&A group, Ismail enjoyed the entrepreneurial feel of the boutique firm. In the relatively newer role, he was able to take on greater duties allowing for fast growth and exposure to knowledge. Ismail explained, “M&A gives you a diverse skill set and unique way to look at things.”</p>
                        <p class="mb-30">Nearing his graduation, Ismail leaned towards a generalist role in investment banking to  explore new sectors, clients and deliver a more meaningful impact. In his full-time role at PJT Partners, Ismail started in the Restructuring & Special Situations group. He also mentioned this role can appear as unattractive to Candian graduates, with few pursuing such roles in the country. He pointed out that this service is imperative to the underlying survival of their clients as the work can be encapsulated as “Breaking a company and putting it back together, allowing you to get a really good insight and perspective based on their capital structure.”</p>
                        <p class="mb-30">Overall, Ismail’s time at SAF and his career have solidified his understanding of what it takes for prospective students to explore finance themselves. Starting from day one, it’s important to have some sort of interest that you can explore or act upon through your time during your undergraduate career. As recruitment processes are starting earlier, having a plan based on interest can allow students to ultimately use their co-op, experiences and other tools to position candidates better each time. Being well-rounded in today’s age is important. University presents for many, the first opportunity to have personal growth and a successful student will be one who is able to leverage that for themselves. Trying to be well- rounded is not just important for recruitment but life. “You want to be professional, enthusiastic and interesting.”.</p>                        
                        <p class="mb-30">At the School of Accounting and Finance, having a support system and network of peers who can support you, help leverage resources, bounce ideas and share advice is something Ismail is extremely lucky for. “Go out of your way to try and meet people early on especially in your first year. People will have different strengths and perspectives and be active in the SAF community to position yourself to ultimately meet friends for life.” Ismail also had the chance to participate in competitions during his time, placing first for both the  Pacific Venture Capital and Battle on Bay competitions in his final year. “I think my best memories were competitions...it felt like a paid vacation to hang out with some of my best friends.” These experiences were filled with memories and opportunities to develop as a young professional through unique networking opportunities. Leveraging the competition subsidies SAF has to offer can enhance the overall experience a student has in their undergraduate careers from both personal and professional aspects.</p>                        
                        <p class="mb-30">Finally, it is vital to understand what mentorship really is. To put it simply, “Mentorship and leadership in your life is the most important thing you need to have a successful career... Mentorship needs to be organic, coming from a genuine space."</p>                        
                        <p class="mb-30">Reflecting upon his time, Ismail has one key piece of advice to current students .

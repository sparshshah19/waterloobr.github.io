                                When wars are directly contributing to lining the pockets of those at the top, it stands
                                to question the motives for starting and continuing wars in the first place.

                            <p class="mb-30">
                                In early 2022, tensions started to peak between Russia and Ukraine. As the world's eyes
                                turned from COVID-19 to the rising conflict in the East, more and more corporations
                                started to pledge their support for Ukraine by pulling out of Russia and ceasing
                                business with the Russian people. McDonald's said it would temporarily shut down its
                                850+ restaurants in Russia, while Starbucks also said that its 100 coffee shops in the
                                country would close their doors.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                L'Or√©al and Estee Lauder both closed shop and ceased online sales to the country, with
                                Estee Lauder in particular losing one of their most profitable markets. Manufacturers
                                such as Nestle, Mondelez, and Procter & Gamble halted investment in Russia but said they
                                would continue providing essentials. The reason behind many of these decisions was to
                                detract from the Russian economy and take a public stance on the war. Statements
                                released had similar reasoning along the lines of "shareholders will not stand for the
                                continued generation of profits from Russia".
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30"><b>Losses</b></p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                One would think that this is a noble thing to do. The amount of business lost for these
                                companies was astronomical, especially with the combined effects of the COVID-19
                                recession from just before. Foreign companies that halted operations in Russia or pulled
                                out completely have incurred losses of more than $240 billion in total since the end of
                                February 2022. A whopping total of $70 - $90 billion was lost on the very first day of
                                the Russia/Ukraine war alone.
                            </p>

                                Surely this amount would cripple the Russian economy, right? However, this seems to be
                                the opposite of true. As a result of new closures, rich businessmen and high net worth
                                individuals started buying shuttered locations and establishing Russian-owned chains in
                                their place. For instance, when McDonald's stopped operating in Russia in February (and
                                fully exited the country by May), Siberian mining oligarch Alexander Govor bought the
                                large majority of locations and converted them into a new Russian burger chain called
                                Vkusno i tochka (meaning "Tasty and that's it"). Similarly, old Starbucks locations are
                                now being converted into ‚ÄúStars Coffee‚Äù by its new owners, Pro-Putin rapper Timur
                                Yunusov (Timati) and restaurateur Anton Pinskiy.

                                Russia once housed the world's busiest McDonalds in Pushkin Square, opened during the
                                Soviet era. This was a powerful symbol of Western influence and global unity, bridging
                                the gap between past and present. Fast forward to 2022, McDonald's write-off from
                                exiting Russia will be between $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. Just closing its
                                restaurants for the first few weeks in Russia hit earnings significantly, costing them
                                $127 million that quarter. Now, the old locations are once again a symbol of Russian
                                nationalism, with new Russian corporations taking over and further bolstering the
                                Russian economy by keeping money flowing within the confines of their own borders. The
                                World Bank predicted that the Russian economy will grow by 11.2% as a result of the
                                invasion.

                                It may be surprising to learn that what happened here is not unique. The oligarchs of
                                today's day and age draw many parallels to the powerful and wealthy boyar class of
                                late-medieval Muscovy (present day central Russia). Historian Edward L. Keenan described
                                boyars as ‚Äúthe top rung of the aristocracy‚Äù in the 1400s, with their influence heavily
                                ingrained in Russia's political system. Flash forward to now, Russia still has a
                                disproportionate amount of oligarchs and higher-than-average levels of wealth disparity,
                                both linked to the collapse of the Soviet Union in the nineties.

                                The majority of this group of elite businessmen gained their wealth through purchasing
                                newly privatized Soviet Union Assets. Since ownership of state assets was contested,
                                many of these transactions happened under questionable circumstances with ex-USSR
                                officials at a severe discount to market rate. As a result, this class has essentially
                                become the ruling tier of Russia, owning the majority of economic assets in the nation.
                                Not only do Russia's oligarchs have superior influence over business and economics, but
                                they also control a large part of the country's politics, media, and governance. New
                                policies that they influence, directly or indirectly, allow for them to continue growing
                                their wealth at a significant advantage over others. In 1996, prominent oligarchs Roman
                                Abramovich, Michail Khordorkovsky, Boris Berezovsky, and Vladimir Potanin helped fund
                                the re-election of Yeltsin (Russia's first president after Gorbachev) in exchange for
                                favorable policies surrounding loan-for-share purchases, their predominant method of
                                acquiring assets for cheap. These four oligarchs made up four out of the seven most
                                powerful men in the nation, who were known as the "seven-banker outfit" for the
                                incredible power and influence over Yeltsin's government. It is estimated that these 7
                                controlled between 50-70% of the entire Russian economy from 1996-2000. Controlling the
                                economic assets allows oligarchs to be front and center of any decision making party,
                                and thus completing the cycle that cements their status.

                            <p class="mb-30">
                                When Putin was first elected in 2000, he vowed to crack down on corruption and exile
                                certain oligarchs. In reality, the old oligarchs who remained friendly with Putin were
                                able to continue prospering so long as they stayed out of his way politically. Many of
                                Putin's friends and former KGB colleagues have also become newly minted oligarchs,
                                creating a new class of silovikis, which translates roughly to "men of force." Gennady
                                Timchenko, a long time friend of Putin, is an excellent example of this. Putin granted
                                Timchenko one of the first oil export licenses in 1991, which allowed him to co-found
                                the oil company Gunvor in 2000. Gunvor grew to control 35% of the state's oil exports
                                within the first few years of operation, however, until that point was still considered
                                a ‚Äúniche player‚Äù in the market due to mostly exporting Russian oil through Estonia.
                                Gunvor's expansion really started to kick off at the tail end of the 2008 economic
                                crisis. While the majority of Russia was struggling, Timchenko's company took over two
                                terminals in strategic points for international exports. Meanwhile, Gunvor's subsidiary
                                companies began expanding laterally by taking over other companies in the construction
                                and gas sectors and seeking access to oil fields. Timchenko himself previously owned
                                shares in and controlled numerous smaller companies, such as Waterway Petroleum and
                                Clearlake Shipping, and the financial crisis allowed him to strengthen these positions
                                as well. Timchenko's group took everything ‚Äúvirtually overnight‚Äù. Today, Gunvor is the
                                fourth largest crude oil trader in the world and with Russia being the world's largest
                                exporter of oil in 2021, they are in a favorable position to continue moving even
                                higher. In 2008, Forbes estimated Timchenko's fortune at USD $2.5 billion. Today,
                                Timchenko sits at an estimated $23.1 billion, making him the 6th richest person in
                                Russia.

                                In traditional Western capitalist societies, businesses only profit when they perform a
                                service that is useful to people. People only pay for items or services that benefit
                                them in some way. However, in Russia, the rules of the game are blurry, hidden and
                                rewritten to the benefit of those who stand to profit the most. The country's social and
                                political dynamics are strikingly similar to the Russian Matryoshka nesting doll. There
                                are multiple layers of ownership, politics, and social ties that must be uncovered in in
                                order to find the true beneficiaries of any policy or decision. Gunvor and Timchenko's
                                success was strongly favored by the Putin administration. There was already limited
                                competition in the energy industry (as it is considered a strategic sector) and all
                                decisions about ownership of particular assets had to be approved by the Kremlin. Gunvor
                                received preferential treatment in deals, negotiations, and loans that were inaccessible
                                to ‚Äúregular‚Äù firms, such as the loan worth $545 million that was granted for their 2008
                                terminal constructions. Gunvor would not be where it is today without Putin‚Äôs favorite
                                aid.¬†

                                So what has been seen so far? As a result of tough economic crises like wars or
                                recessions, the rich get richer, companies get consolidated/monopolized, and citizens
                                get less bargaining power. The oligarchs at the top continue silently winning, profiting
                                from favorable government policies and the rapid sell-offs of assets. Meanwhile, the
                                average Russian working-class citizens and the global economy are the ones who suffer.
                                But what is there to do about it?

                            <p class="mb-30"><b>Sanctions</b></p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                For the longest time, the answer was 'sanctions'. However, sanctions only seem to drive
                                the ruling class closer together. Boris and Arkady Rotenberg, two brothers who rose to
                                siloviki status under Putin, were first sanctioned by the US back in 2014 for their
                                repeated participation and enabling of ‚ÄúPutin pet projects‚Äù. The most notable of these
                                was their construction of the Kerch Strait Bridge, a 12-mile bridge that connected
                                Russia with its newly-annexed territory Crimea. This bridge had heavy logistical and
                                political complications associated with it, evident by the circumstances it was built
                                in, however Arkady Rotenburg's company happily did it, completing the bridge in 2018.
                                The sanctions against them ended up working in their favor, as the brothers have proved
                                their allegiance to the Kremlin and have received even larger contacts than before
                                through the government.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                Sanctioning is also simply not an easy task. Property assets are difficult to trace, as
                                they are often held in tax havens, shell companies, or relative's names. Many luxury
                                yachts owned by oligarchs mysteriously 'went missing' at the start of the invasion, with
                                their last reported sightings being months or even years back. "It's hard to say how
                                much their wealth has suffered because we don't know how much they had," said Jodi
                                Vittori, Global Politics and Security professor at Georgetown University.

                                Sanctions also effectively punish everyone due to how interconnected the world is. In
                                fact, sanctions often end up hurting the global economy more than the sanction targets.
                                One example of this is when the US sanctioned billionaire Oleg Deripaska, owner of the
                                United Co. Rusal, in 2018, due to money laundering investigations and a myriad of other
                                charges against him. Rusal was (and still is) one of the world's leading aluminum
                                production companies, and when he and his company counterparts were sanctioned, aluminum
                                prices soared. The crisis only subsided after Deipaska agreed to significantly reduce
                                ownership in the company to meet US Treasury guidelines. This is why even now, in the
                                midst of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, many steel tycoons, fertilizer giants, and other
                                backbone-industry oligarchs are still sanction-free.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                Sanctions did not break the spirit of Russia, and they likely never will. The current
                                class of oligarchs will not stand up to what is going on to what is going on in the war,
                                despite the rising sanctions piling against them. After all, they are the unofficial
                                aristocrats of Russia, and their agreement with Putin is essentially to "stay quiet,
                                stay out of the way, and be handsomely rewarded". Their loyalty is not without reason.
                                Oligarchs like Vladimir Gusinsky and Mikhail Khodorkovsky paid the price for daring to
                                speak their truth, and their stories rest as threats of what happens to those who cross
                                the line.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                Beyond this, however, is a simple fact: war is in the best interest of (the majority of)
                                the ruling class. Oligarchs are incentivized to want the country to go through periods
                                of difficulty, as this allows them to continue to propagate their empireand solidify
                                their wealth. Multinationals like McDonalds and Starbucks rapidly exiting the country
                                doesn‚Äôt send the financial message they think it does. Rather, it creates gaps in the
                                economy that oligarchs are all too eager to buy up and fill. Russian oligarchs have a
                                long history of profiting off times of crisis, and unfortunately, the current
                                socio-political structure of Russia continues to enable this.
                            </p>

                                At its heart, the Russia-Ukraine war is trading human loss for capital gain. It is a
                                battle of politics, greed, and selfishness. The response in the West cannot be to pull
                                out our multinational companies or economically sanction the country, as we only hurt
                                ourselves and make the ruling class stronger. The real root of this problem must be
                                targeted in order to create tangible change, not just for the people of Ukraine, but for
                                the society of Russia as well.

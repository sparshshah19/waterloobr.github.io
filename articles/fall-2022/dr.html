                                In the world of the autonomous, people like to believe that nothing is impossible. Most
                                of the time, this philosophy is a good thing. The ability to build systems that can
                                alleviate human dependencies and provide quick and efficient solutions means that
                                society as a whole can move faster, quicker, and more efficiently. However, sometimes
                                the world moves so quickly and with such fervor to break barriers and innovate, that it
                                seemingly disregards the bumps along the road. Whether or not it's a product of
                                ignorance, the smaller problems that bubble underneath the clear, undisturbed image of
                                any form of advancement are not revealed until it's too late. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                Whether people want to look to the present day with the advent of new-age
                                cryptocurrencies and their fun penchant for consumer fraud, or the very pandemic that
                                destabilized the current economy, every major conflict has begun by distracting
                                themselves with the obvious problems right in front of them with the sensationalization
                                of something new and profitable. Accompanied by an unfathomable belief that they know
                                what they are doing, it is no wonder that the root cause of these issues can be traced
                                back to their inception.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                When it comes to the technological bubble, the reality is that only a few people really
                                know what’s going on and the true consequences of what’s being created. Bots and spam,
                                which had been the bedrock of any piece of technology for decades, are part of that
                                trend. A bump in the road for that matter is treated as unimportant. Unfortunately,
                                we’re about to realize that’s not the case at all. Bots are not just a nuisance, and are
                                far more dangerous weapons than we realize.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                With automation at its peak, the infestation of bots and spam online has reached a
                                potential point of no return. Soon the internet will begin to collapse in on itself and
                                the line between real and fake will become impossible to differentiate. With the power
                                to sway public opinion now so accessible to anyone with an agenda, the internet finds
                                itself entering its own digital recession, a time of socio-political uncertainty where
                                the world is truly at the mercy of the anonymous.

                            <p class="mb-30">
                                Before someone can understand why bots and spam are so dangerous, they need to first
                                understand how they work in the first place as well as their connection to modern-day
                                automation. Automation is the use of technology applications to minimize human input.
                                It’s the creation and application of technologies to complete tasks with reduced human
                                interaction.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30">Bots in general can be used for good purposes, such as search engine
                                    bots which manifest themselves as web crawlers. These can review content on websites
                                    and index them so that they show up on web searches. Copyright bots also exist and
                                    review content that violates copyright laws. Site monitoring bots frequently monitor
                                    for website metrics and any potential issues such as system outages or backlinks. In
                                    other words, bots are surprisingly a cornerstone for a lot of modern-day processes
                                    that allow the internet to function the way that it does. The real issue arises when
                                    these bots are warped and become delivery systems for the most dangerous viruses on
                                    the internet. Delivery systems we refer to as spam.</p>

                                The bots that can be programmed for malicious intent are referred to as “Bad Bots”.
                                Think of it as someone who has been infected with a virus. Since bots make up over half
                                of all web traffic, unprotected websites hosted by unqualified individuals on the
                                internet can become a prolific target. These “bad bots” can also come in several forms.
                                There are scraper bots that are programmed to steal content, such as pricing and product
                                information so businesses can undermine the pricing strategies of a target. There are
                                spam bots (which are the most common) that target community portals, and social media,
                                and interfere with online conversations by inserting unwanted advertisements, links,
                                banners, political agendas, etc. Finally, there are scalper bots that target ticketing
                                websites to purchase hundreds of tickets as soon as bookings open to later resell the
                                tickets at inflated prices.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                All of these bots - good and bad - are possible because of the proliferation of AI
                                technologies to the general public. If automation is possible and easy, then so are
                                bots. If bots are real, then it becomes impossible to tell what isn’t. These bots more
                                than anything affect perception online. Repeatedly sharing misinformation and fake news

                                extreme views, and skewing poll data are only a few examples of what’s possible and
                                already happening. When this reality exists, truth on the internet means nothing.

                                A good example of this is modern-day uses of ChatGPT. For context, ChatGPT is an
                                open-source AI similar to Siri or Alexa, but far more advanced. If you go onto the
                                platform and tell it to write you a fraudulent email that can be used to “phish”
                                someone, it will create that for you. If you tell it to build a program for you that can
                                spam hate comments on YouTube, it will create that for you. It will do all that in
                                milliseconds without any moral qualms. AI is only a tool, but bots are the actual
                                weapon.

                                Most of the misunderstanding behind these “bad bots” is that people think they are
                                employed by groups of unrelated, and unconnected people. However, bots and spam are less
                                random than we think and have transitioned into their own form of organized crime.

                                On most occasions, they are operated by movements of large groups who have some sort of
                                intention to target people and distort the majority narrative online. These groups are
                                often the homes of a “Botnet” which is a group of one or more interconnected devices
                                that each run a bot that forms a system of bots that can

                                collaborate to perform DDoS attacks, post spam, etc. Surprisingly though, these botnets
                                are not a new occurrence and have been around for years. The first instance of a botnet
                                was a trojan called Sub7 that was released in 1999, just a few years after popular good
                                bots started becoming relevant such as the Googlebot web crawler released in 1996. A
                                more popular example is Trojan - a bad bot that disguises itself as legitimate software
                                and instead is designed to damage your computer, steal data, disrupt your network, etc.

                                One of the most significant botnets in history however was called Pretty Park. It was an
                                email worm that was also released in 1999 that would come attached to emails. When
                                executed,  it would install itself onto the system and then send email messages through
                                the computer to the address book. It could also be used as a backdoor into the computer.
                                For context, a worm is a type of malware whose primary function is to self-replicate and
                                infect other computers while remaining active on infected systems. This particular worm
                                paved the way for several major botnets that rose to prevalence in the mid-2000s such as
                                Storm, which was one of the most aggressive pieces of malware known yet. It spread
                                through links within messages that attempted to get users to download malware from a
                                website. Storm has affected an estimate of over 1 million computers to date.

                                The prevalence of these “botnets” are evidence of the fact that they work more like an
                                underground digital crime organization than pockets of random unconnected individuals
                                and this makes them that much more dangerous.

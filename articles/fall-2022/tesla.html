                            <p class="mb-30">
                                The energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable power is one of the most talked
                                about topics in today’s discourse, and for a good reason. The world is already
                                experiencing the effects of climate change, whether it be through the increasing
                                frequency and severity of natural disasters, or rising sea levels threatening the entire
                                existence of several Pacific islands, or the increased difficulty of growing crops in
                                increasingly hot and arid regions. Of course, where there is opportunity, there will be
                                entrepreneurs who find a way to capitalize on it. One such entrepreneur who capitalized
                                on the threat posed by climate change is Elon Musk, who helped fund Tesla at its early
                                stages and eventually was appointed CEO after quite a bit of chaos amongst the rank and
                                file of the company. Tesla started out as just an Electric Vehicle (EV) company, but
                                their overall mission has always been to accelerate the advent of sustainable
                                transportation, through their other business ventures, such as solar panels. This was
                                made evident with their merger with SolarCity, operating charger stations, as well as
                                the building of its battery storage capabilities. In general, Tesla has bucked the trend
                                of most auto giants, who mostly outsource to contractors, by increasing its level of
                                vertical integration to 80%, according to a Goldman Sachs analyst. While there have been
                                integration challenges in this regard, the company continues to make progress in
                                becoming a more integrated producer of electric vehicles.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                Now, Tesla has done quite a bit to try to bring electric vehicle production in-house.
                                They produce the batteries within their cars themselves, and have also inked offtake
                                agreements with lithium producers, which allow them to have more or less a guaranteed
                                flow of lithium for the years to come. However, there is significant potential for Tesla
                                to take everything several steps further. As of now, Tesla’s main focus is mostly on
                                cementing its place as one of the world’s pre-eminent electric vehicle producers.
                                However, an electrified future relies more on bolstering the electric grid in its
                                entirety, rather than just churning out electric vehicles en masse - this is one of the
                                biggest challenges faced in the energy transition. As this article will show, Tesla can
                                replicate its vertically integrated model to expand to the broader electrical
                                infrastructure industry through its Tesla Energy segment, a space which presents a
                                massive market opportunity for the company to scale up within.

                            <p class="mb-30">
                                It’s no secret that America’s infrastructure is falling apart. According to the White
                                House, public infrastructure spending relative to GDP has fallen by over 40% since the
                                1960s. Moreover, 20% of America’s roads and over 45,000 bridges are in disrepair. A
                                large portion of America’s water supply still relies on dangerous and toxic lead pipes.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                Many of these infrastructural concerns apply to the electric grid as well. The average
                                lifespan of transmission lines is 50 years. Most of America’s transmission lines are
                                over 40 years old, and according to Swiss Re, malfunctions tend to escalate during this
                                time. As over 90% of America’s power grid relies on these transmission lines, our
                                reliance on this system does not bode well for the future.
                            </p>

                                However, this isn’t the worst of it. The data used by the operators of this
                                infrastructure to make major decisions relies on past data which doesn’t factor in
                                climate change, which means that the country’s electric grid isn’t equipped to tackle
                                the challenges brought on by climate change. To make matters worse, as demand for
                                electricity spikes due to the proliferation of electric vehicles, the grid has already
                                shown weakness. A heatwave, which knocked out several power plants in Texas earlier this
                                year, forced Texans to limit electricity from vital services, such as air conditioning.
                                Similarly, California asked residents to stop charging their EVs due to climate
                                conditions at the same time that the state was mulling EV adoption and instituting bans
                                on internal combustion engine cars.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                This situation further does not consider another issue laying between the intersection
                                of electric vehicles and the power grid - what good are electric vehicles if the
                                electricity used to charge them is produced from dirty energy? Despite growing interest
                                in renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, there remains the issue of
                                intermittency. For example, wind power generates electricity mostly during the earliest
                                and latest hours of the day. Due to poor renewable energy storage infrastructure across
                                the world, this means that excess energy is generated during these times, when there is
                                often less demand, and thus must be “dumped” for free. This limits the ability to
                                actually scale renewable energy; however, large scale battery energy storage solutions
                                offer a solution to this. That being said, actual penetration of BESS systems is quite
                                low across the world, meaning there will need to be significant capital expenditure
                                required on this front.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                Clearly, for the energy transition to actually go through, there will need to be
                                trillions of dollars spent refurbishing the country’s infrastructure. Currently, there
                                is already a lot of infrastructure funding surrounding the power grid. President Biden’s
                                Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal outlines the government’s plans to invest more than $65
                                billion to upgrade our power infrastructure by building new transmission lines and the
                                funding of new programs to support the development of clean energy technologies. In
                                addition to this, this legislation will accelerate widespread adoption of electric
                                vehicles through investing $7.5 billion to create a national network of EV chargers
                                throughout America. This provides huge opportunities for companies with expertise in the
                                area of electric power to obtain billions of dollars worth of contracts to upgrade
                                America’s infrastructure, then accessing massive annuity-like contracts to maintain it.
                                Tesla, by virtue of its vertically integrated nature encompassing power generation,
                                power storage, and manufacturing the end products of EVs, is in a unique position to
                                forge the partnerships needed to equip itself to fill this gap and cement a position for
                                itself within the broader infrastructure space.

                            <p class="mb-30">
                                Tesla is highly knowledgeable in the electrical industry due to its subsidiary, Tesla
                                Energy. Originally known as SolarCity, Tesla acquired the clean energy company in 2016,
                                where they mainly focused on the sale of solar panels for homeowners. Tesla Energy has
                                since launched three products: the Solar Roof, the Powerwall, and most recently, the
                                Megapack. Functioning similar to traditional solar panels, the Solar Roof is essentially
                                solar panels seamlessly integrated into roofs through combining glass solar tiles with
                                steel roofing tiles. Tesla’s Powerwall is a battery storage solution that allows
                                homeowners to store excess solar energy. Lastly, the Megapack is a similar energy
                                storage product to the Powerwall, just on a larger scale for commercial projects. In
                                fact, energy storage is something that Tesla has begun to hone in on more, with the
                                company’s overall mission statement being “to accelerate the world’s transition to
                                sustainable energy”. In 2021, Tesla began building a production facility that will be
                                able to produce 40 million kWh of energy storage per year in Austin, Texas. An average
                                home in America uses 10,632 kWH of energy a year, meaning that this would be able to
                                power 3762 houses.
                            </p>

                                In addition to this expansion, Tesla reports that energy storage and solar panel
                                deployment has grown 62% and 13% respectively in the third quarter of 2022. An emphasis
                                on cross-selling solar power installations with the Powerwall and making products more
                                widely available increased Tesla Energy revenues to $1.117 billion, a 38.6%
                                year-over-year increase during the third quarter of 2022. These developments are crucial
                                for Tesla in both solving key problems of tempermental power grids, and in expanding in
                                the energy storage market.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                Tesla has used their expertise in energy storage to offer timely support for the US in
                                times of need. For example, in 2021 when Hurricane Ida hit the New Orleans area the
                                power grid was shut down and became inoperable for several weeks. Tesla was able to
                                provide power to over 1,000 people by deploying powerwalls and solar panel disaster
                                relief systems. With proven capabilities in the electrical industry, Tesla can look to
                                provide more long-term energy storage solutions to American consumers, and even more
                                importantly, to renewable energy projects which can make use of Tesla’s capabilities in
                                battery energy storage solutions. By storing excess energy instead of having to dispatch
                                it, the economics on renewable energy development projects will increase, which
                                incentivizes further construction of renewable capacity, which benefits the nation from
                                an energy transition perspective, and the consequent demand for even more energy
                                storage, which benefits Tesla. Currently in Texas, Tesla is piloting a service where
                                selected Powerwall users can sell the energy generated from their solar panels back to
                                the power grid. Furthermore, they have created their own utilities company, Tesla Energy
                                Ventures and gained approval to set up a Virtual Power Plant in Texas. This is a method
                                where Tesla can draw energy from all individual batteries to the grid which eliminates
                                the need for natural gas fire beaker plants during periods of high energy demand. So
                                far, these developments are promising indicators of Tesla’s ability to venture into
                                sustainable energy storage for consumers all over the US.

                            <p class="mb-30">
                                Now, further expansion into this space is easier said than done. If Tesla is to move
                                into larger scale development of energy storage solutions and electric transmission
                                infrastructure, this will mean that its cost structure will tilt towards relatively
                                volatile commodity prices, such as copper. Tesla has already been working on hedging out
                                its risks through offtakes and potentially outight acquisitions of lithium projects.
                                However, the raw materials needed in this proposed transformation would be on a whole
                                different level.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                Some of the key metals needed in this scenario include copper, lithium, and nickel.
                                These three all have quite interesting situations. Copper production is most
                                concentrated within South America, the US, and Russia, with a relatively mature
                                production profile. Lithium, on the other hand, is a bit more nascent in the sense that
                                most production occurs in Australia or South America, but there are a massive flurry of
                                development projects underway worldwide, including within the US and Canada. Nickel is
                                another metal which has been receiving increased attention due to its importance in
                                batteries and also within the wind industry - Indonesia is the dominant producer
                                worldwide.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                Acquiring battery metal mines is a strategic move that can help Tesla achieve more
                                vertical integration and control over costs. By owning the mines, Tesla can secure a
                                steady supply of critical components, reduce dependence on external suppliers, and
                                increase control over the supply chain. In this section, we will take a look at four key
                                battery metals: lithium, cobalt, nickel, and copper, and examine the potential benefits
                                and costs of acquiring mines for Lithium is a crucial component in lithium-ion
                                batteries, which are used in electric vehicles. As demand for electric vehicles
                                continues to rise, the demand for lithium is also expected to increase significantly.
                                Some of the main lithium mines are located in countries like Australia, Chile, and
                                Argentina; however, there are an increasing number of lithium projects under development
                                in both North America and Europe, which are closer to Tesla’s gigafactories in the US
                                and Germany. Nickel is another important metal for battery production and is used in the
                                cathode of lithium-ion batteries. Mines for nickel can be found in Canada, Russia, and
                                Indonesia, among other nations. Due to the high concentration of production from more
                                geopolitically volatile nations like Russia and Indonesia, it makes sense for Tesla to
                                acquire mines and help finance their expansion to lock in supply. Finally, copper is
                                used in the wiring of electric vehicles and is important for both battery production and
                                broader electric infrastructure. Mines for copper can be found in countries such as
                                Chile, Peru, and China. Therefore, by Tesla acquiring these battery metal mines, it will
                                achieve vertical integration, have a steady supply of key components, and reduce
                                dependence on external suppliers.

                            <p class="mb-30">
                                Tesla has the potential to leverage its business model to expand to the broader
                                electrical industry through placing bigger importance on its Tesla Energy segment.
                                Tesla, unlike other electrical vehicle companies, has already expanded their operations
                                in the electricity generating and storing industry through their solar panels and
                                batteries. Furthermore, acquiring the mines is a crucial part in furthering their
                                expansions, as Tesla gains significant advantages in reducing the overall costs of
                                production, and increased control over its products and services. Of course, there will
                                be arguments that Tesla does not have the expertise to operate mines - while this is
                                true, it is also mitigated by the fact that Tesla can just keep the same management in
                                place and act as a more passive manager. There are several non-specialized global
                                conglomerates with mining operations, such as Sumitomo, which sets a precedent that
                                non-mining companies can own mines.
                            </p>

                                Using their expertise, access to valuable materials, and knowing the deteriorating power
                                grid in America, Tesla has significant financial gain to make through forming
                                partnerships to improve and create new infrastructure that will ultimately reduce
                                Americans' reliance on the outdated and faulty power grid system. In conclusion, as the
                                electrical industry continues to evolve with an emphasis on renewable energy supported
                                by the government, and the popularization of electrical vehicles, Tesla is in the
                                perfect position with their resources to be at the forefront of the future electrical
                                industry.

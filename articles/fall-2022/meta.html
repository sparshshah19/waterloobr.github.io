                                This last year has proven to be considerably difficult for FANNG businesses, which were
                                largely responsible for a majority of the economic growth in 2020 and 2021. During that
                                period, however, Facebook made a defining choice in its business model by prioritizing
                                Metaverse products in their business model. In October of 2021, they leaned heavily into
                                this new segment and restructured their business entirely around it, with the most
                                prolific change being their name change from Facebook to Meta. However, as economic
                                policy shifted towards a more constrained environment, the company found itself ensnared
                                in what was once its most promising venture. Recently, the Metaverse has been faltering
                                due to the lack of regulation, fraudulent activity, and wavering demand. If this
                                pessimistic outlook on an integral part of Meta’s expected future success doesn’t
                                change, this may lead to a failure to realize the potential of their Metaverse
                                investment and bring the business to its demise due to an adjacent lack of priority in
                                their social media segment which is facing monetization and competitive headwinds.

                                However, before we go into the company's troubling situation, it helps to know how it
                                got there in the first place and this requires some context.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30"><b>The Pre-Meta Period:</b></p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                In its early years, Facebook was an app solely targeted to college students, but this
                                model shifted once Facebook saw incredible traction within a short period; the app
                                reached 1 million users in ten months. The company had a mission to connect people and
                                communities by taking the social experience online. Over the next 14 years, growth was
                                defined by a combination of user growth and key acquisitions which have played a
                                defining role in their business to date. Targeted advertising became their key driver of
                                revenue, as they provided much higher engagement metrics than traditional advertising
                                solutions would at the time, thanks to their data collection.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30"><b>Beginning of the End:</b></p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                That brings them to a fundamental problem. What happens if people don’t want to join the
                                platform anymore or potentially even leave? The threat of obsolescence is especially
                                prevalent in industries experiencing intense competition. They could fight this by
                                acquiring businesses which complement their main platform, which worked with Instagram.
                                Well, that's exactly what they did, and this resulted in two important events to bring
                                them to where they are today. It first gave them the first taste of what the Metaverse
                                had to offer through their acquisition of Oculus in 2014, and second, it began a long
                                and winded string of antitrust issues with regulators which hindered their ability to
                                remain acquisitive in a timely manner.

                            <p class="mb-30">
                                Eight years after Facebook acquired Instagram, the Federal Trade Commission announced
                                that they were suing Facebook for “illegally maintaining its personal social networking
                                monopoly through a years-long course of anticompetitive conduct.” They requested an
                                injunction to force the divestment of Instagram and Whatsapp, pitching that it occurred
                                due to the existential threats they posed to the Facebook-Messenger monopoly. The case
                                is on-going with a trial expected to begin sometime by the end of 2023 to 2024 which
                                puts a potential countdown on the businesses performance. Regulatory headwinds were
                                further exacerbated one year later as in 2021, as a product manager at Facebook named
                                Frances Haugen came forward and released confidential documents to whistleblow
                                malpractice within the business. These documents revealed troubling information about
                                both Facebook and Mark Zuckerburg, with topics including societal and political ailments
                                inflicted in the name of profitability. The senate demanded Zuckerburg appear before
                                them and address the issues and were not impressed with how it was handled, making
                                mention of their favor towards the break-up of the monopoly.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                On top of that, the industry was rapidly changing as fierce competition ripped away
                                market share, most notably being TikTok. The proliferation of short-form content was
                                something they fought against through the implementation of Reels. While the reels
                                segment lags behind TikToks engagement rates, Instagram overall has a mature and robust
                                advertising infrastructure with better conversion, click-through, and return on ad
                                spend. This exemplifies their importance in Facebook's portfolio holdings, since the
                                ability to copy competitors only works due to their large user-base and preferable
                                advertising infrastructure. What does all this mean? Facebook is on a countdown to a
                                trial which could result in the divestment of their most productive segment and main
                                defense against competitors. Their acquisitive nature cannot sufficiently cushion the
                                risk they face since every acquisition they pursue is under intense regulatory scrutiny
                                to ensure competition remains unhindered. This leaves just one option still open.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                This brings them to a pivotal moment in their life cycle, where they began betting on
                                the idea of the Metaverse. The Metaverse is a virtual world accessible through the
                                internet where users can do things like go to an office and work, hang out in a park,
                                and other things that are normally done in person like going to a concert. Second Life,
                                one of the most popular realized Metaverses, allowed characters to do these things while
                                playing as cartoon versions of themselves and even let users speculate on their digital
                                real estate. People were spending ~$100M per year on purchases within the world with
                                some having well over $1M worth of virtual real estate holdings. The rationale for the
                                Oculus acquisition was to make it applicable to more social gathering like what was
                                mentioned above, a far cry from their initial value proposition of gaming. However,
                                competition from the broader gaming segment like Sony’s VR headset which was made for
                                Playstation and lackluster demand for online social gathering applications like
                                mentioned above made it difficult for their products to gain any traction.

                                When all hope seemed lost for their VR vision, the pandemic presented a unique
                                opportunity for the business. Speculative trading activity was at its highest through a
                                swift recovery in the markets, after the blow dealt by lockdown led people towards
                                making money from home. At the same time, cryptocurrency was in the greatest bull run in
                                its history and everyone was trying to get out ahead of any new trend which could make
                                money. These tailwinds put Oculus at the forefront of their new envisioned future. In
                                2021, Facebook committed itself to this shift by changing the parent company name to
                                Meta Platform. The shift was a big piece of news to take the heat off and put them in a
                                new light. Google did the same thing in 2015 by restructuring themselves under a new
                                parent company called Alphabet to differentiate its search engine from the multitude of
                                other ventures it has underway. The Facebook name change is indicative of a fundamental
                                shift towards their prioritization of the Metaverse within their business model.

                                While their Metaverse plans were in development, new headwinds came along with Apple's
                                new privacy laws taking a bite into the Facebook social media segment projected
                                advertising revenue. At the time, this was a massive deal for the entire app store with
                                nearly every company losing 15% to 20% of their total advertising income and Facebook
                                losing over $10B of revenue. The tracking came in the form of collecting user data on
                                other websites to determine search patterns to help optimize targeted ads but Apple
                                implemented an update in iOS 14 which forces the apps to ask permission in whether they
                                would like to be tracked and people turning it off  created overall lower quality
                                targeted ads. Zuckerberg publicly denounced the new policy implementation in a press
                                release but mentioned that the company would be able to navigate the challenges due to
                                their long-term investments. The company had been recently testing out a new application
                                which was invite-only for a period in which users who had VR Headsets could collaborate
                                with other users in practical manners (I.E. having virtual meeting rooms, whiteboards,
                                etc.) and after some fine-tuning, the app known as Horizon Worlds was released to the
                                public.

                                That brings us to today, where Meta Platforms is facing one of its biggest dilemmas with
                                its foundational and growth-oriented value propositions, and is now on the clock to find
                                a way to innovate or fall victim to their headwinds. These significant investments into
                                the Metaverse and fundamental shift towards the prioritization of its success needs to
                                work out for the company because the Facebook and Instagram services still are facing
                                massive pressure to be broken up by the FTC. With Instagram being the leading service
                                provider among the two with the greatest amount of growth and composition of total
                                revenue, this would leave the parent company in practically irresolvable turmoil without
                                anything to fall back on. With the potential loss of their flagship social media
                                staples, we need to understand better what it is they’re falling back on and the

                                Meta’s goal with this shift is pursuing what's called the Infrastructure Control Model,
                                where they essentially control the hardware infrastructure as a proprietary entry point
                                for users but can easily shift to other content providers, just like an iPhone. On top
                                of that, they’re looking to develop a creator economy to attract and retain users in the
                                application which cannot be accessed anywhere else due to its tech specifications with
                                their headsets. In an ideal world, demand for the various services and products would be
                                similar to that of the in-real-life alternatives and they would make a fee on every
                                single transaction that occurs (on those concerts, real estate purchases, etc.).

                                No long-term outlook as to what they consider success has been provided beyond
                                short-term guidance for 2022 and their results. At the beginning of the year, Horizon
                                Worlds hit a 300,000 user milestone and by the end had only 200,000 Horizon Worlds hit a
                                300,000 user milestone and by the end had only 200,000 Monthly Active Users (MAU) with
                                the projected users being 500,000. They also found that only 9% of the 10,000 built
                                worlds were ever visited by more than 50 users. These statistics show that while growth
                                is a big part of their problem, retention of users needs to be considered as well. The
                                marketing for the product has also seemingly been unsuccessful since there's a large
                                disparity between groups of internet users who’ve have heard about horizon worlds and
                                those who haven’t:

                                The underperformance is attributable to their value proposition. While other successful
                                VR/M-World companies tend toward the gaming experiences, Meta’s betting on the social

                                to penetrate the market deeper as they capitalize off their gaming infrastructure. On
                                top of all this, the biggest reason investors are against the venture is their inability
                                to monetize Horizon World which makes it a cash-burner with bad unit economics and
                                generally no robust demand. Back in 2021, they had broadly defined what success looked
                                like to them with their Metaverse expansion:

                                The goal of hosting $100B+ of digital commerce and 1B people on their platform helps to
                                define what their idea of success looks like, but can they achieve this? To understand
                                that better, it makes sense to define some of the market's current dynamics, how those
                                are expected to evolve over time, and where Meta fits into that bigger picture. Within
                                the Meta Platforms realm, the Metaverse can be defined as the cumulation of three big
                                drivers; the AR/XR utilization, the 3D elements, and the infrastructure required to host
                                successful metaverses.

                                The AR/XR application has been pursued through the creation of their Meta Quest 2
                                headset. While it isn’t necessary to purchase the Meta Quest headset to access Horizon
                                Worlds, that is a significant driver in the advancement of monetization through targeted
                                advertising. By tracking user movements, Meta Quest users can be identified with 95%
                                accuracy. In the capturing of this biomechanical data, it can near instantaneously
                                create equivalent ROAS metrics for applications with access to it. Furthermore, it can
                                predict your habits, understand your vulnerabilities, and create a much more granular
                                marketing profile with the sole intent of attention gatherings, all of which can easily
                                attract and retain new advertisers.

                                The 3D elements of the Metaverse bifurcate the different existing types of metaverses
                                and are complemented with the AR/VR capabilities. Games like Minecraft and Roblox can be
                                defined as Metaverse in-themselves, yet are fundamentally different as they operate in a
                                2D world. They’re economic success can be attributed to their prioritization of the
                                experiential layer. User experiences are the biggest drivers of a successful 3D World
                                and without it, capitalistic interests cannot be pursued. Meta significantly lacks from
                                this perspective since Horizon Worlds is reportedly filled with bugs, low quality
                                visuals, and an overall lacking things to do. The experiential layer is only successful
                                thanks to Meta Quests ability to connect to PC games, which are third-party developed
                                and released.

                                The most complicated piece of them all is the infrastructure layer of Metaverse
                                development. The existing technology stack is too underdeveloped (or nonexistent) to
                                help developers build more scalable and overall better AR/VR applications. In the same
                                way that cloud libraries filled with photos or work is stored on a server owned by a
                                large company, the Metaverse is going to require the same thing except will need over
                                1000x more computing power, speed, and storage than currently being used. With the
                                industry being in its early stage, one way Meta’s addressing the issue is through
                                perusal of strategic partnerships. For example, Meta partnered with NVIDIA to expand
                                their technical infrastructure and components required to sustain the M-World.

                                The industry is highly fragmented and that opens the door to consolidation as large
                                players' roles become more defined. They’ll have the capital to either commit to
                                companies who will lead the creation of these specialized projects or acquire them as a
                                means to penetrate the market. There are a few issues which arise with Meta Platforms
                                doing this; namely their time constraint due to the lawsuit with regulators, the
                                specialized nature of the industry conflicting with their vision, and major ethical and
                                regulatory implications.

                                not a priority. For Meta Platforms to succeed, they may need to broaden their vision and
                                their shift towards the Metaverse and away from social media. The development of
                                infrastructure is expected to decrease in cost thanks to newer technologies like AI (and
                                is something the company has begun to develop). Companies with the technical
                                capabilities to complete the project could be acquired by Meta Platforms to bring these
                                projects to life.

                                regulatory considerations. Currently, the regulatory environment is heavily lagging but
                                research is being done regarding policy to determine the best next steps. Meta Platforms
                                has historically had issues regarding data trading and access to more sensitive
                                information through AR/VR headset usage. Global regulatory organizations deal with these
                                dilemmas differently, some on a continent-wide basis and some down to local levels, but
                                the consensus is that if the ethical dilemmas aren’t considered seriously, irreversible
                                damage can be done. With increasing fraudulence on the Facebook website, a lack of
                                priority towards the ethical considerations would open the company to new headwinds
                                going forward if they don’t find a way to align shareholder, customer and their own
                                values.

                                The future of Meta Platforms and its various services is hazy at best but this
                                transitionary period will be one that defines them going forward. In the short-term,
                                their focus should be on refining the experiential layers of their product offering
                                since this is the easiest to implement. They could also continue developing partnerships
                                among industry leaders and smaller players to get their foot into the doors of
                                sub-niches they expect to grow and can serve through resource provision or through an
                                acquisition. The issue with this is the amount of time it would take to acquire and
                                integrate the company and realize synergies which would conflict with the count-down of
                                their lawsuit with the FTC.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                While the business historically has been considered a social media company, this
                                situation may give them the chance to reorient themselves in a different direction. If
                                the business walks away from the lawsuit unscathed, they could see unequivocal success
                                thriving in two industries with significant markets. If they fail to integrate the
                                Metaverse solutions in time and the lawsuit forces a divestment in Instagram, Meta
                                Platforms would remain a shell of its former self. Only time will tell the results, but
                                one thing certain is that these next couple years will define the company going forward.

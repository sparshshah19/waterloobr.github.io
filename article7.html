            <h3>Introduction</h3>

            <p>The American dream is at the heart of Forever 21. Created by husband-and-wife duo Do Won and Jin Sook
                Chang, the couple emigrated from South Korea to Los Angeles in 1981 in hopes of a better future. By
                1984, the Changs opened up the first Forever 21, then known as Fashion21 in California, making $700,000
                USD in sales in its first year. By 1989, the first mall store was opened, and the company went
                international in 2001 by opening their first Canadian retail store. At its peak, Forever 21 was
                generating 4.4B in revenue with over 700 stores worldwide; the Changs had gone from working class
                immigrants, to becoming billionaires.<sup>1</sup> They had achieved the American dream. However, all was
                brought to
                a halt with their recent bankruptcy filing. How did this American dream turn into a nightmare? What led
                Forever21 to file for bankruptcy in a market that is still heavily reliant on fast fashion brands? It is
                evident that Forever 21’s business strategy, marketing plan, and its focus on the “now” is the ultimate
                reason they might not have a “future”.
            </p>

            <img src="images/article7Images/Timeline [UPDATED].png" alt="Forever 21's Journey" class="singleImg"
                id="journey">

            <h3>Market
            </h3>

            <p>Fast fashion is the rapid production of inexpensive clothing to reflect the latest trends. Many fast
                fashion brands have been accused of exploiting workers from third world countries to sustain this
                business model. Today's shoppers are increasingly moving away from fast fashion to sustainable clothing,
                a key contributor to Forever 21's 44-store shut-down and eventual bankruptcy. Although sustainability
                and the green consumer are rising trends, Forever 21's fast fashion competitors such as Fashion Nova,
                Wish, and Zaful do not face the same solvency issues of the former market leader. Therefore, even with
                changing consumer tastes, Forever 21 could have avoided its fate. If the problem isn’t with the market,
                could Forever 21’s strategy be at fault?
            </p>

            <h3>Business Strategy
            </h3>

            <p>It is difficult to identify exactly who Forever 21 is targeted towards, especially when looking at its
                product mix. Forever 21 carries clothing for women, men and children of all sizes, and have also
                ventured into sportswear, swimwear and undergarments.<sup>2</sup> In addition, they carry a large
                assortment of
                additional product lines such as accessories, footwear, skincare and beauty supplies. The only thing
                Forever 21 lacked, however, was one particular target market. Forever 21’s strategy was to saturate as
                many consumer segments as possible with a multitude of products, facilitated by cheap production and
                distribution costs.
            </p>

            <p>Furthermore, surrounding market positioning, Forever 21 focused its efforts on establishing a presence
                through physical stores in shopping centres and outlet malls. Three years prior to its bankruptcy filing,
                Forever 21 opened 600 of their 700 outlets, representing an annual growth rate of 91%.<sup>3</sup> This
                strategy
                was unsustainably aggressive relative to H&M’s strategy of steady growth, which has allowed it to
                establish 5000 stores at an annual growth rate of 5%.<sup>4</sup>
            </p>

            <p>Forever 21’s brand presence, emphasizing physical stores, however, may have diverted their attention from
                capturing the growing e-commerce market. For example, Forever 21 did not focus on marketing efforts
                through advertising campaigns such as TV advertising space or celebrity collaborations. Management
                assumed the physical presence of their outlets was sufficient marketing: another justification for their
                slow transition.<sup>5</sup>
            </p>

            <p>Finally, Forever 21 operates using a centralized management. Being a private company with 99% equity
                owned by the Chang family, only a select number of individuals had the power to make impactful
                decisions. With only the Change family as central management, there was a lack of outside parties to
                object to their standard strategy: focus on the now and maximize profits in the short run. In an
                interview with CNN, Do Won Chang explained that being a private company has helped in making decisions
                extremely quickly.<sup>6</sup> Similarly, without external insight, there were no outside consultations
                from
                industry experts who could have provided them with alternative ideas for longstanding success.
            </p>

                id="storeImg">


            <h3 id="moreImportant"> What Went Wrong
            </h3>

            <h3>Their Target Market is the Market</h3>

            <p>Forever 21 was initially targeted for consumers in their 20s, who as Do Won Chang later explained were
                for “Old people who wanted to be 21 again, and young people who wanted to be 21
                forever”.<sup>7</sup> This
                suggests that their target market was not defined by a particular demographic, but rather an experience.
                To accomplish this, Forever 21 focused on producing clothing according to current fashion trends. This
                allowed them to cater towards a large demographic as all ages looked to buy the latest trend. At the
                time, this worked quite successfully, allowing Forever 21 to capture a large audience with one style.
                But as trends went, so did their appeal. With no specific target market in mind, Forever 21’s resources
                were put towards replicating trends with a rapid pace, and subsequently, they lacked in-depth knowledge
                of a particular demographic. Their lack of a target market became apparent when retailers who knew more
                about specific demographics created products specifically to fit their niche. Coupled with industry
                headwinds, consumers left to look for more tailored customer experiences.
            </p>

            <p>As a result, their expansive product mix led them to stray away from their original business model,
                trendy and affordable clothing, and instead spread themselves thin across many different demographics.
                Although this strategy of “demographic diversification” proved profitable until 2015, it did not prove
                for brand longevity, especially as consumer tastes changed.<sup>8</sup> When they expanded their product
                lines to
                include makeup, home décor, men’s and children’s clothing, Forever 21 struggled to maintain the allure
                that made them successful.
            </p>

            <p>Compounded by Forever 21’s relatively poor product quality, its inability to capture any single
                demographic segment further cemented Forever 21’s demise.</p>

            <h3>How are People Buying from F21?
            </h3>

            <p>Before filing for bankruptcy, there were 44 stores in Canada and 700 stores worldwide. Forever 21
                aggressively pursued growth through in-store purchases and increasing their retail footprint. However,
                their store expansion led to poor margins and low profitability as increased rental expenses ate up 30%
                of revenues. As the industry turned to e-commerce, Forever 21 was left behind. E-commerce based
                businesses have higher margins and growth within the industry. While Forever 21 concentrated on
                generating sales in their physical stores, competitors made upwards of 30% of revenues through
                e-commerce, nearly double those of Forever 21(16%).<sup>9</sup> Even with surveys demonstrating that
                millennials
                in the U.S. made more than half of their purchases online<sup>10</sup>, the focus was still on Forever
                21’s
                physical footprint.
            </p>

            <h3>The Social Media Campaign… Or Lack Thereof?
            </h3>

            <p>Forever 21’s marketing budget reiterates its misunderstanding of current trends, as the US budget went
                from $800,000 in 2017 to under $344,375 by 2018. Similarly, in 2019, only $383,000 was been spent on
                marketing, with search engine optimization using the majority of the budget.<sup>11</sup> Their
                marketing efforts
                paled in comparison to other brands such as H&M, their biggest competitor, which spent a little under
                $100 million on advertising.<sup>12</sup> In a time where consumer engagement through marketing is
                crucial ,
                Forever 21 seemed to move in the opposite direction.
            </p>

            <p>As a result, Forever 21’s social media engagement was severely lacking. Their social media platform was
                scattered and had minimal potential for sales conversions. Firstly, their branding was segmented across
                a multitude of accounts, supposedly targeted towards different demographics. Just to name a few, Forever
                21 had a Canadian account, a men’s account, and a plus size account.
            </p>

            <p>When looking at H&M or FashionNova, they both utilize their large audiences by posting several posts a
                day that have links to their promotions on their online store. This additional level of interaction of
                the competitors has raised a competitive edge against Forever 21 as not only do they engage further with
                their audience, but they also focus their efforts to generate their online sales through social media
                platforms.
            </p>

                alt="Comparision of F21's Statistics with other brands" class="singleImg" id="stats">

            <h3>The Cost of Copyright
            </h3>

            <p>Legality is also another aspect to consider when looking at the structure and success of Forever 21.
                Forever 21 has been sued over 50 times for allegedly stealing works from Diane von Furstenberg to Gwen
                Stefani and most recently, Ariana Grande.<sup>13</sup> Of all these cases, only one case with the label
                Trovata was
                settled in courts.<sup>14</sup> Forever 21 gets away with these lawsuits because of copyright
                law.<sup>15</sup> Specifically,
                copying a design or a piece of clothing verbatim is not technically illegal because the law doesn’t
                prohibit creative expression and can thus allow Forever 21 to ‘copy’ designs.<sup>16</sup> Under the
                Innovative
                Design Protection and Piracy Act, in the US, it lays out the rights of artists and designers to be
                protected from others copying their works of art, including the designs; however, this legislation does
                not include clothing as it is considered a “useful article”.<sup>17</sup> For this reason, large
                enterprises, such
                as Forever 21, may be excused of copyright law as there is no legislation that is limiting them from
                copying the designs, especially if they are not patented by the designer.
            </p>

            <p>While Forever 21 has been able to avoid consequences in the courtroom, they have suffered greatly in
                their trial against public opinion. In a recent advertising campaign, Forever 21 victimized Ariana
                Grande by copying her “7 Rings” music video outfit. Although the $10m financial loss wasn’t substantial,
                their brand image was negatively impacted.<sup>18</sup> The backlash of Forever 21’s reputation by
                prominent public
                figures ultimately accelerated the other consequences of their marketing strategy. As there was an
                absence of response to these public claims and no attempt to salvage their reputation, the damage
                incurred by these copyright issues indirectly caused losses greater than the settlement themselves.
            </p>

                alt="Comparision of F21's post with Ariana Grande's 7 Rings Music Video" class="singleImg" id="ariana">

            <h3>Aftermath and Next Steps
            </h3>

            <p>Due to its poor financials and ineffective marketing position, Forever 21 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
                protection which allowed the company to continue operating a few stores. Around 350 stores will be shut
                down globally including all 44 Canadian stores.<sup>19</sup>
            </p>

            <p>Forever 21 is a prime example of how the American Dream can quickly turn into a nightmare. Their strategy
                to hastily expand their business without looking at how they were positioning themselves in the market
                ultimately led to their bankruptcy filing.
            </p>

            <p>In the meantime, Forever 21 has focused its efforts on the American market, with an emphasis on
                restructuring and reevaluating their strategy. Due to the nature of Forever 21’s business model, it is
                difficult to determine mine what the next steps will be. In the meantime however, only assumptions can
                be made regarding Forever 21’s future.

                            <p> ​At its peak, Forever 21 had over 700 stores worldwide, and took the Changs, its
                                owners, from working class immigrants to billionaires. However, all was brought to a
                                halt
                                with their recent September 2019 bankruptcy. How did this American dream turn into a
                                nightmare? What led Forever 21 to file for bankruptcy in a market that is still
                                heavily
                                reliant on fast
                                fashion brands? Take a look behind the business and marketing strategies that
                                contributed
                                to the collapse of oneof the world’s leading brands.</p>

                            <p>​In 2017, after raising $100 billion, Softbank launched Vision Fund, one of the
                                largest technology venture funds in the world. However, after numerous failed
                                investments
                                in firms like
                                Wag and WeWork, skeptics are beginning to question the strategy this fund has
                                adopted.
                                What can we learn from the Vision Fund’s failures, and what are the implications for
                                the
                                broader industry?</p>

        ("s", "Introduction"),
        ("p", "In early 2022, tensions started to peak between Russia and Ukraine. As the world's eyes turned from COVID-19 to the rising conflict in the East, more and more corporations started to pledge their support for Ukraine by pulling out of Russia and ceasing business with the Russian people. McDonald's said it would temporarily shut down its 850+ restaurants in Russia, while Starbucks also said that its 100 coffee shops in the country would close their doors."),
        ("p", "L'Oréal and Estee Lauder both closed shop and ceased online sales to the country, with Estee Lauder in particular losing one of their most profitable markets. Manufacturers such as Nestle, Mondelez, and Procter & Gamble halted investment in Russia but said they would continue providing essentials. The reason behind many of these decisions was to detract from the Russian economy and take a public stance on the war. Statements released had similar reasoning along the lines of \"shareholders will not stand for the continued generation of profits from Russia\"."),
        ("s", "Losses"),
        ("p", "One would think that this is a noble thing to do. The amount of business lost for these companies was astronomical, especially with the combined effects of the COVID-19 recession from just before. Foreign companies that halted operations in Russia or pulled out completely have incurred losses of more than $240 billion in total since the end of February 2022. A whopping total of $70 - $90 billion was lost on the very first day of the Russia/Ukraine war alone.  "),
        ("i", "c-1"),
        ("p", "Surely this amount would cripple the Russian economy, right? However, this seems to be the opposite of true. As a result of new closures, rich businessmen and high net worth individuals started buying shuttered locations and establishing Russian-owned chains in their place.  For instance, when McDonald's stopped operating in Russia in February (and fully exited the country by May), Siberian mining oligarch Alexander Govor bought the large majority of locations and converted them into a new Russian burger chain called Vkusno i tochka (meaning \"Tasty and that's it\"). Similarly, old Starbucks locations are now being converted into “Stars Coffee” by its new owners, Pro-Putin rapper Timur Yunusov (Timati) and restaurateur Anton Pinskiy."),
        ("i", "c-2"),
        ("p", "Russia once housed the world's busiest McDonalds in Pushkin Square, opened during the Soviet era. This was a powerful symbol of Western influence and global unity, bridging the gap between past and present. Fast forward to 2022, McDonald's write-off from exiting Russia will be between $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. Just closing its restaurants for the first few weeks  in Russia hit earnings significantly, costing them $127 million that quarter. Now, the old locations are once again a symbol of Russian nationalism, with new Russian corporations taking over and further bolstering the Russian economy by keeping money flowing within the confines of their own borders. The World Bank predicted that the Russian economy will grow by 11.2% as a result of the invasion."),
        ("i", "c-3"),
        ("s", "Oligarchs"),
        ("p", "It may be surprising to learn that what happened here is not unique. The oligarchs of today's day and age draw many parallels to the powerful and wealthy boyar class of late-medieval Muscovy (present day central Russia). Historian Edward L. Keenan described boyars as “the top rung of the aristocracy” in the 1400s, with their influence heavily ingrained in Russia's political system. Flash forward to now, Russia still has a disproportionate amount of oligarchs and higher-than-average levels of wealth disparity, both linked to the collapse of the Soviet Union in the nineties."),
        ("i", "c-4"),
        ("p", "The majority of this group of elite businessmen gained their wealth through purchasing newly privatized Soviet Union Assets. Since ownership of state assets was contested, many of these transactions happened under questionable circumstances with ex-USSR officials at a severe discount to market rate. As a result, this class has essentially become the ruling tier of Russia, owning the majority of economic assets in the nation. Not only do Russia's oligarchs have superior influence over business and economics, but they also control a large part of the country's politics, media, and governance. New policies that they influence, directly or indirectly, allow for them to continue growing their wealth at a significant advantage over others. In 1996, prominent oligarchs Roman  Abramovich, Michail Khordorkovsky, Boris Berezovsky, and Vladimir Potanin helped fund the re-election of Yeltsin (Russia's first president after Gorbachev) in exchange for favorable policies surrounding loan-for-share purchases, their predominant method of acquiring assets for cheap. These four oligarchs made up four out of the seven most powerful men in the nation, who were known as the \"seven-banker outfit\" for the incredible power and influence over Yeltsin's government. It is estimated that these 7 controlled between 50-70% of the entire Russian economy from 1996-2000.  Controlling the economic assets allows oligarchs to be front and center of any decision making party, and thus completing the cycle that cements their status."),
        ("s", "The Putin Era"),
        ("p", "When Putin was first elected in 2000, he vowed to crack down on corruption and exile certain oligarchs. In reality, the old oligarchs who remained friendly with Putin were able to continue prospering so long as they stayed out of his way politically. Many of Putin's friends and former KGB colleagues have also become newly minted oligarchs, creating a new class of silovikis, which translates roughly to \"men of force.\" Gennady Timchenko, a long time friend of Putin, is an excellent example of this. Putin granted Timchenko one of the first oil export licenses in 1991, which allowed him to co-found the oil company Gunvor in 2000. Gunvor grew to control 35% of the state's oil exports within the first few years of operation, however, until that point was still considered a “niche player” in the market due to mostly exporting Russian oil through Estonia. Gunvor's expansion really started to kick off at the tail end of the 2008 economic crisis. While the majority of Russia was struggling, Timchenko's company took over two terminals in strategic points for international exports. Meanwhile, Gunvor's subsidiary companies began expanding laterally by taking over other companies in the construction and gas sectors and seeking access to oil fields. Timchenko himself previously owned shares in and controlled numerous smaller companies, such as Waterway Petroleum and Clearlake Shipping, and the financial crisis allowed him to strengthen these positions as well. Timchenko's group took everything “virtually overnight”. Today, Gunvor is the fourth largest crude oil trader in the world and with Russia being the world's largest exporter of oil in 2021, they are in a favorable position to continue moving even higher. In 2008, Forbes estimated Timchenko's fortune at USD $2.5 billion. Today, Timchenko sits at an estimated $23.1 billion, making him the 6th richest person in Russia."),
        ("i", "c-5"),
        ("p", "In traditional Western capitalist societies, businesses only profit when they perform a service that is useful to people. People only pay for items or services that benefit them in some way. However, in Russia, the rules of the game are blurry, hidden and rewritten to the benefit of those who stand to profit the most. The country's social and political dynamics are strikingly similar to the Russian Matryoshka nesting doll. There are multiple layers of ownership, politics, and social ties that must be uncovered in in order to find the true beneficiaries of any policy or decision. Gunvor and Timchenko's success was strongly favored by the Putin administration. There was already limited competition in the energy industry (as it is considered a strategic sector) and all decisions about ownership of particular assets had to be approved by the Kremlin. Gunvor received preferential treatment in deals, negotiations, and loans that were inaccessible to “regular” firms, such as the loan worth $545 million that was granted for their 2008 terminal constructions. Gunvor would not be where it is today without Putin’s favorite aid. "),
        ("p", "So what has been seen so far? As a result of tough economic crises like wars or recessions, the rich get richer, companies get consolidated/monopolized, and citizens get less bargaining power. The oligarchs at the top continue silently winning, profiting from favorable government policies and the rapid sell-offs of assets. Meanwhile, the average Russian working-class citizens and the global economy are the ones who suffer. But what is there to do about it?"),
        ("s", "Sanctions"),
        ("p", "For the longest time, the answer was 'sanctions'. However, sanctions only seem to drive the ruling class closer together. Boris and Arkady Rotenberg, two brothers who rose to siloviki status under Putin, were first sanctioned by the US back in 2014 for their repeated participation and enabling of “Putin pet projects”. The most notable of these was their construction of the Kerch Strait Bridge, a 12-mile bridge that connected Russia with its newly-annexed territory Crimea. This bridge had heavy logistical and political complications associated with it, evident by the circumstances it was built in, however Arkady Rotenburg's company happily did it, completing the bridge in 2018. The sanctions against them ended up working in their favor, as the brothers have proved their allegiance to the Kremlin and have received even larger contacts than before through the government."),
        ("p", "Sanctioning is also simply not an easy task. Property assets are difficult to trace, as they are often held in tax havens, shell companies, or relative's names. Many luxury yachts owned by oligarchs mysteriously 'went missing' at the start of the invasion, with their last reported sightings being months or even years back. \"It's hard to say how much their wealth has suffered because we don't know how much they had,\" said Jodi Vittori, Global Politics and Security professor at Georgetown University."),
        ("i", "c-6"),
        ("p", "Sanctions also effectively punish everyone due to how interconnected the world is. In fact, sanctions often end up hurting the global economy more than the sanction targets. One example of this is when the US sanctioned billionaire Oleg Deripaska, owner of the United Co. Rusal, in 2018, due to money laundering investigations and a myriad of other charges against him. Rusal was (and still is) one of the world's leading aluminum production companies, and when he and his company counterparts were sanctioned, aluminum prices soared. The crisis only subsided after Deipaska agreed to significantly reduce ownership in the company to meet US Treasury guidelines. This is why even now, in the midst of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, many steel tycoons, fertilizer giants, and other backbone-industry oligarchs are still sanction-free. "),
        ("p", "Sanctions did not break the spirit of Russia, and they likely never will. The current class of oligarchs will not stand up  to what is going on to what is going on in the war, despite the rising sanctions piling against them. After all, they are the unofficial aristocrats of Russia, and their agreement with Putin is essentially to \"stay quiet, stay out of the way, and be handsomely rewarded\". Their loyalty is not without reason. Oligarchs like Vladimir Gusinsky and Mikhail Khodorkovsky paid the price for daring to speak their truth, and their stories rest as threats of what happens to those who cross the line."),
        ("p", "Beyond this, however, is a simple fact: war is in the best interest of (the majority of) the ruling class. Oligarchs are incentivized to want the country to go through periods of difficulty, as this allows them to continue to propagate their empireand solidify their wealth. Multinationals like McDonalds and Starbucks rapidly exiting the country doesn’t send the financial message they think it does. Rather, it creates gaps in the economy that oligarchs are all too eager to buy up and fill. Russian oligarchs have a long history of profiting off times of crisis, and unfortunately, the current socio-political structure of Russia continues to enable this."),
        ("p", "At its heart, the Russia-Ukraine war is trading human loss for capital gain. It is a battle of politics,  greed, and selfishness.  The response in the West cannot be to pull out our multinational companies or economically sanction the country, as we only hurt ourselves and make the ruling class stronger. The real root of this problem must be targeted in order to create tangible change, not just for the people of Ukraine, but for the society of Russia as well."),

        ("s","Introduction"),
        ("p","In 1959, around 1700 billion cubic meters of natural gas were found in Holland’s Groningen region. At the time, gas prices were near their all time high and the Dutch had a relatively strong ability to harvest oil through the Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij (NAM), which was jointly owned by Esso and Shell. The discovery of natural gas was believed to enable the Dutch economy to grow and prosper, which it appeared to do so through the 70s: the Dutch Guilder appreciated by 16.4% between 1971 and 1977, social security benefits made up over 23% of national income versus 16.5% in 1970, and regulations were put in place establishing minimum wages, employment standards and environmental standards. The discovery of natural gas seemed to pave a road to long-term prosperity for the region."),
        ("p","By 1977, 80% of government revenue came from the natural gas. Despite the positive outlook at the time, the country began to crumble from the inside out. Industrial production had not increased during the 70s and employment in the manufacturing industry, which was once Holland’s strongest industry, declined by 16%. Corporate investment fell nearly 15%, and the proportion of people that qualified for their long-term benefits program increased from 20% in 1965 to more than 60% in 1977. Their overreliance on natural gas exports led to a dollar so strong that Holland could not sell any other goods for a reasonable price. This interior collapse of a nation, despite a positive economic image, was coined as the term “Dutch Disease”."),
        ("i","d-1"),
        ("p","At the time, Dutch Disease was believed to be caused by an overreliance on one export. However, in the time since, it appears as though many nations have found success by relying on a single export, while others have been destroyed by it. Though previously unavoidable and misunderstood, Dutch Disease plagues nations that rely solely on one export but is entirely avoidable through strong fiscal policy."),
        ("s","Modern Single-Export Nations"),
        ("p","Dutch disease introduced the concept that relying on a singular export has harmful repercussions. However, when we look at today’s economy, we see many successful and unsuccessful nations that were born out of single export reliance, with common trends arising from both sides. Oil-rich countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE come to mind as nations that have been able to utilize the export they rely upon to prosper. Though diversification might be the obvious answer to their success, entering new industries is extremely challenging when a nation does not have strong leadership or direction. The leaders of these oil rich nations have chosen to do 3 main things: invest in a sovereign wealth fund, invest in strategic industries, and control their oil companies. "),
        ("p","Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are investment vehicles that are often funded by natural resources and are used by a nation to diversify their interests into different industries. Based on size, the UAE’s SWF is the 3rd largest, Saudi Arabia’s is the 6th largest and Qatar’s is the 9th largest globally. These SWFs invest into industries that the host country had not found success in, such as Qatar’s SWFs investments into sports and tech, or the UAE’s investments into technology and travel. This presents a unique way to avoid Dutch disease, as a nation's rising dollar affects their exports but not investments."),
        ("i","d-2"),
        ("p","The industries that these nations appear to invest most in are the tourism and business. It appears as though their main goal is to bring foreigners in and keep them there for various reasons. For wealthy businesspeople, this means giving large tax incentives to encourage the growth of tech and finance in the country. For poor migrant workers, this means cheap labor and infrastructure development. It's a way for these oil-rich countries to increase their economic complexity while not actually relying on exports, but rather being attractive destinations to visit or live in, and using their high dollar to earn greater revenue from these newcomers."),
        ("i","d-3"),
        ("p","The final piece of this puzzle is overall government control. If the government can control the oil companies and those who operate it, they can avoid issues from Dutch Disease that were akin to the nations overreliance on their oil workers. Currently, roughly half of the world's oil production comes from state-owned companies such as Sinopec, QatarEnergy, Emirates National Oil, Aramco and Kuwait Oil Company, which are all from Asia and the Middle East. This number is expected to grow over the next decade as they are entirely self-sustaining and can collaborate through OPEC: an organization made up of oil nations like Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and others around the Middle East. Having a central power in charge of a country’s main oil company ensures decisive action and a greater ability to secure a strong workforce, while ensuring that oil profits suit the nations need. After all, the rulers get rich as the nation gets rich, so it is in their best interest for oil production to continue."),
        ("s","Unsuccessful Single-Export Nations"),
        ("p","The question then arises of how any nation can be unsuccessful with one export when there are clear examples of those that have grown tremendously from their oil. Surely there is a set of examples they can follow in order to prosper from their main export? Countries today still have deteriorating economies similar to Dutch Disease due to various factors that prevent them from capitalizing on their greatest export."),
        ("p","Single export nations that are unsuccessful appear almost “forced” to be reliant on one export, not by circumstance but by outside forces. Banana republics are the perfect example of this. "),
        ("p","Banana Republics are South American nations that are reliant entirely on bananas for their economic expansion and became this way through foreign intervention. The rise of Banana Republics was mainly due to the United Fruit Company, who’s first operation in 1871 started by building a railroad through Guatemala and Honduras. After realizing that the project was not profitable and having been granted over 800,000 acres of land along the railroad, they decided to expand into banana production. With control of over 13% of the surrounding nations land mass and over 4000 workers by the 1930s, the United Fruit Company had a heavy influence over the government purely because of the profit they brought the nation. The ultimatum was simple: if the government does not comply with the United Fruit Company, they could leave the nation and deprive them of their most successful export. The most extreme case of government control came in December 1928, when the famous “Banana Massacre'' left an estimated 2000 workers dead after they were protesting their abhorrent living conditions while working in banana farms. The massacre was led out by the Columbian military who were pressured by the United Fruit Company to bring their labor back into work. The United Fruit Company had enough control of the country that they could coerce Colombian leadership to lead out a massacre on their own people, who were protesting the conditions that they were subjected to by a foreign company, just for the country to get a meager share of the profits."),
        ("i","d-4"),
        ("p","This presents the main differentiating factor in successful and unsuccessful single-export nations: whoever controls the companies controls the profits. Successful nations own their companies, such as Saudi-owned Aramco and Qatar-controlled QatarEnergy. When profits are funneled out of a poor nation by a foreign power, the living conditions in that nation do not improve and thus it is more challenging to diversify. When large companies are state-owned, investment can be made to better the nation and prosper."),
        ("p","A common argument is that the type of export is the main factor which decides if a nation will be successful or not successful. After all, while oil-rich countries such as the UAE and Qatar have thrived, banana-rich countries have suffered. Though one might argue that Banana Republics are unsuccessful because their export is less desirable in today’s economy, Nigeria has suffered in similar ways despite their main export also being oil."),
        ("p","95% of Nigeria’s exports are oil exports, which make up 40% of their total economy. The vast majority of their oil wells are owned by Shell, who “purchased” oil fields from the economy through shady-looking purchases that involved bribed government officials. Most notably, the $1.3B purchase  of OPL 245 led to $466M in the pockets of government officials. Today, the country is so reliant on the oil giant that 65% of their government revenue comes from oil. Though the relationship was initially symbiotic with Shell gaining new oil fields and Nigeria getting new infrastructure, foreign investment, labor opportunities and profits, Shell’s immense power was abused through massive oil spills (they admitted to around 250 oil spills per year from 1997-2006) and power consolidation. One of the most noteworthy acts is their devastation of Ogoniland, a 1000km  add delta that was poisoned with oil spills, which Shell paid $83M to fix despite the UNEP estimating that a $1B fund is needed to correct the environmental damage. "),
        ("i","d-5"),
        ("p","In 1994, Shell was also accused of complicity when 9 Ogoni men were protesting alongside the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) and got arrested and executed. only $15.5M was paid to their families as settlement. These countries were taken over by companies that demanded more power and destroyed their nations by making them reliant on the exports that earned them the most profit. Dutch Disease is strong in nations that have higher dollars and labor forces that are empowered by their reliance on one export, but it is also strong in nations where their other exports are destroyed by monopolization and their labor forces are suppressed by their own governments that act as puppets to foreign conglomerates."),
        ("s","What defines success?"),
        ("p","In the times of Dutch Disease, it was believed that being reliant on one export caused nations to fail. The same was seen in the 1970s when Great Britain found oil off the coast of Scotland and they fell in a recession despite oil prices quadrupling. However, we’ve seen nations such as the UAE and Qatar become net oil exporters while successful, and net exporters such as Nigeria and Banana Republics be unsuccessful. So what causes this difference?"),
        ("p","We’ve already established that the type of export has little influence on the country's success, with some oil nations finding success and some not. The UAE and Qatar were once poor countries with exports such as fishing and farming, but were able to transform into global superpowers. Nigeria is in a similar situation to pre-oil middle eastern countries, but are still finding it difficult to progress. The main success factors lie beyond the type of export."),
        ("p","The other main idea is the possibility of collaboration. The largest oil exporters are members of OPEC, which allows these countries to control global trade of oil by setting volume mandates. If a country like Nigeria could join OPEC, it could perhaps find more success by being able to collaborate with some of the other exporters. Banana Republics could form their own type of OPEC and control global banana exports, asserting how much volume can be distributed and controlling prices as a result. However, there is one large factor that prevents this from being possible that defines the main factor which separates successful and unsuccessful single export nations."),
        ("p","The success of single export nations is solely dependent on their foreign policy and level of government control. When a nation is able to learn from the lessons of Dutch Disease and quickly expand into new industries through an investment vehicle or government spending, they are able to benefit from their profits from any export that they might rely on. This is only possible with strong foreign policy, where spending is constantly monitored and trends are understood."),
        ("i","d-6"),
        ("p","We spoke with an individual from the IMF who has studied the effects of foreign policy on the success of a nation. Through in-depth discussion and ideation, we learned that nations suffer when their economies are informal and their labor costs are too high, which pose as barriers to growth as the nation might try to create an entity to generate profit through successful exports. The defining factor between success and failure in the eyes of this individual was a country's economic framework. Countries need to control their exports, but their success is defined by much more than that: they also need to look at their education levels, their labor laws and their investments. The way forward for suffering nations is unclear, said this individual, but they must start by taking control of their resources and using their profits to encourage long term prosperity."),
        ("s","Conclusion"),
        ("p","It appears as though the goal of every single export nation is to diversify away from that export. This is seen globally through the Middle East's growth in tourism, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund and even Canada’s own pension plans that were developed from their oil sands. Dutch Disease is a condition gained from being reliant on an export for too long, and these countries are trying their best to diversify as quickly as possible in order to avoid the condition. This is simply not possible when foreign companies obtain too much share of a nation's profits and prohibits them from expanding into new industries and rather forces them to stay entirely focused on the one export that brings them the most success for their bottom line. The solution is clear: control the profits and invest them in a way where the country can avoid over reliance."),
